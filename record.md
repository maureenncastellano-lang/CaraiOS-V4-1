# Agency OS — Build Record

Running log of every change made to the codebase, in the order it happened.
Companion to `Agency-OS-Master-Plan.md` (the architecture/roadmap) — this file
is the changelog: what was actually built, tested, and verified, session by
session. Nothing goes in here as "done" unless it was run against a live
server and produced the expected result.

Base codebase: **CaraiOS v3** (Python/FastAPI), chosen over DevOS Platform's
Node backend per the consolidation decision — see Master Plan §"Immediate
Next Actions". DevOS's Monaco IDE / Git panel / Composer frontend is the
planned UI layer; these backend routes exist so that frontend has something
real to talk to.

---

## Session 1 — Stage 1 gap-closing: Files, Git, Terminal APIs

**Goal:** DevOS's frontend (file tree, git panel, terminal) had no backend to
call in CaraiOS v3. Built the missing FastAPI routes.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `execution/files.py` | `FileService` — list/read/write/create/rename/delete, scoped to `data/projects/{user_id}/{project_id}/` (same convention `brain/builder.py` already used). Path-traversal protected via `_resolve()`. |
| `execution/vcs.py` | `GitService` — status/init/stage/unstage/commit/push/pull/checkout/log. Shells out to system `git`, no new dependency (fits `requirements-lite.txt`). |
| `execution/terminal.py` | `TerminalService` — command-at-a-time shell execution scoped to the project dir. Deliberately **not** the same code path as `governance/sandbox.py`'s `SandboxedExecutor` (that one is for Brain-authored code snippets in an ephemeral dir; this is for a human typing into their own project's terminal). Catastrophic-pattern denylist (fork bombs, `rm -rf /`, disk-wipe `dd`), output cap, timeout cap. Not a full PTY — no curses apps — by design, to avoid adding `ptyprocess`/node-pty-equivalent as a dependency. |
| `api/routes/files.py` | REST routes for the above. `delete` is routed through the existing `HITLQueue` — same approval gate an autonomous agent's `delete_file` action would hit, so a human deleting via the IDE and an agent deleting autonomously are held to the same standard. |
| `api/routes/vcs.py` | REST routes for git operations. |
| `api/routes/terminal.py` | `POST /run` (buffered) and `WS /ws` (streaming, one command at a time, authenticated via a first `{"token": ...}` message since WebSockets from a separate-origin frontend can't reliably carry cookies). |

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `app.py` | Registered `files`, `vcs`, `terminal` routers | New routes need wiring in |
| `governance/tool_contracts.py` | Added `write_file`, `read_file`, `git_commit`, `git_push`, `run_terminal` tool contracts | Per the architecture decision that capabilities are governance objects — these needed to be first-class registry entries, not routes that bypass it. `git_push` marked `is_reversible=False` (HITL-gated for autonomous use, since it publishes outside the sandbox). |
| `api/routes/auth.py` | Added missing `Request` import | **Pre-existing bug**, not introduced by this work — `Request` was used as a type annotation but only imported inside one function. It crashed the entire app on boot the moment any route module imported `auth`. Found by trying to actually start the server. |

### Tested (real HTTP/WS calls against a running server, not just "should work")
- Files: create → write → tree → read, all pass. Path-traversal attempt (`../../../etc/passwd`) correctly returns 400.
- Git: init → status → stage → commit → log, all pass against a real repo, producing a real commit hash.
- Terminal: buffered `run` executes real commands and returns real stdout (ran the file we'd just written); denylisted command (`rm -rf /`) correctly blocked with 403; a command that outlives its timeout is correctly killed and reported.
- WebSocket terminal: streamed `stdout`/`stderr` chunks live, then a `{"done": true, ...}` marker — confirmed with a real `websockets` client.
- Governance integration: firing a `DELETE` on a file correctly blocks on a pending HITL request; nothing happens to the file until `/api/governance/hitl/{id}/approve` is called; only then does the delete execute. Confirmed end-to-end.

### Bugs found and fixed during testing (not before)
1. `auth.py` missing `Request` import — pre-existing, would have broken the whole app on boot.
2. `FileService.tree()` initially leaked `.git` internals into the file listing — caught by actually calling the endpoint after a git init, fixed to exclude `.git/*`.

### Known follow-ups (flagged, not yet fixed)
- `JWT_SECRET` was defaulting to a random value regenerated on every process restart, silently invalidating all sessions. Pinned a fixed value in `.env` for this dev/test cycle — **must be replaced with a securely generated, persisted secret before anything resembling production.**
- This sandbox environment has reset mid-session more than once, killing the running server (filesystem state survives; processes don't). Each session restarts the server fresh and re-verifies rather than assuming continuity — noting it here so it isn't mistaken for a code problem later.

---

## Session 2 — Stage 1: Communications organ (event bus)

**Goal:** per the v2 architecture (Master Plan §1), every organ should talk
through Communications rather than to each other directly. Investigation
found this gap was already explicitly *acknowledged* in the codebase — the
`governance/hitl.py` docstring describes an intended "SSE event pushed to
frontend" flow, and a `HITLQueue.on_new_request()` callback hook existed for
it — but nothing in the codebase ever actually subscribed to it. The push
step was designed but never wired up. This session wired it up for real.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `communications/bus.py` | `EventBus` — singleton in-process async pub/sub. Topics are free-form strings (`user:{user_id}` convention used here, `system` reserved for organ-wide broadcasts). Each topic keeps a bounded 50-event replay buffer so a client that connects slightly late isn't blind to what already happened. Deliberately in-process only for now (fits the Acer Aspire One Micro/Standard profiles); interface is written so a real broker (Redis pub/sub, NATS) could sit behind the same `publish()`/`subscribe()` calls later for genuine distributed execution, without touching callers. |
| `communications/__init__.py` | Package marker |
| `api/routes/comms.py` | `GET /api/comms/stream` — Server-Sent Events endpoint. Token passed as a query param (not header) because browser `EventSource` can't set custom headers. |

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `governance/hitl.py` | `submit()` now publishes a `hitl.pending` event to `EventBus` on topic `user:{user_id}`, in addition to the existing (still-harmless, still-unused-elsewhere) callback list. `resolve()` now publishes `hitl.resolved` the same way, via `asyncio.create_task` since `resolve()` itself is a sync method called from an async route handler. | This is the concrete first case of "organs talk through Communications, not directly to each other" — replacing a dead callback stub with a real, working push mechanism. |
| `app.py` | Registered the `comms` router | New route needs wiring in |
| `.env` | Pinned `JWT_SECRET` to a fixed dev value | Carried over from Session 1's flagged follow-up — needed working sessions to test SSE auth across multiple concurrent requests in the same test run |

### Tested
- Started a real SSE client (Python `httpx` streaming client) subscribed to `/api/comms/stream`.
- While it was connected, fired a file delete (which queues a HITL request) — the SSE client received a live `hitl.pending` event with the full request payload within ~1 second, with no polling.
- Approved the request via the existing governance endpoint — the same SSE client then received `hitl.resolved` live, and the file delete completed only after that.
- Confirmed via server log that only one `EventBus` instance existed (singleton behavior correct) and that the subscriber queue was cleaned up on disconnect.

### Design decisions worth flagging
- The WebSocket terminal (`api/routes/terminal.py`, from Session 1) intentionally does **not** route through the new EventBus — it's inherently point-to-point (one user, one terminal session), and broadcasting terminal output through a shared bus would add complexity with no current benefit. If a future "watch a teammate's terminal" or "stream a background build to multiple subscribers" feature is wanted, that's when it should move onto the bus.
- Distributed execution (multiple CaraiOS processes) is explicitly out of scope for this EventBus — it's single-process in-memory. Flagging now so it isn't mistaken for done later when Stage 7/8 (multi-node deployment) comes up.

---

## Session 3 — Stage 1: Identity extension (delegation_chain + expected_outcome_schema)

**Goal:** close the gap flagged repeatedly in the Master Plan — UCIP's public
spec (and this codebase's own `AgentIdentity`) had no concept of delegation
lineage, and no way to declare "what does success look like" for a goal
before execution starts. Investigation confirmed this precisely: the real
`AgentIdentity` class already existed with `trust_level` and `capabilities`
(more complete than the public UCI repo's bare `actor` string), but had
no `delegation_chain` field and no `delegate()` method — every agent was
either the root user or an unrelated identity, with no traceable lineage
between them. Similarly, `LoopState.goal` was a bare string with nothing
checking whether the final answer actually matched what was asked for.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `governance/identity.py` | `ExpectedOutcome` dataclass (description + optional JSON-schema-like `schema` + bounded `max_correction_attempts`) and `validate_against_schema()` — a small, dependency-free structural validator (required fields, basic types, one level of nesting). Deliberately **not** using the `jsonschema` package, to stay inside `requirements-lite.txt`'s footprint; this is an intentional subset, not a full JSON Schema implementation. |

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `governance/ucip.py` | Added `delegation_chain: list[str]` field to `AgentIdentity`, plus a real `delegate()` method that creates a child identity whose capabilities can only narrow (never exceed) the parent's, bounded further by the child's own trust tier if one is requested. `to_dict()` now includes the chain. `PolicyEngine.evaluate()` now automatically merges `agent.delegation_chain` into every audit record's context — callers don't need to remember to pass it, so Audit can always answer "acting under whose authority?", not just "who literally made this call?". | This is the actual Identity-engine gap closure the Master Plan called for. |
| `core/loop.py` | `LoopState` gained `expected_outcome`, `outcome_correction_attempts`, `outcome_valid` fields. `run()` now accepts an optional `expected_outcome` param. The `mark_complete` handler now validates the Brain's final answer against the declared schema (if any) before accepting completion — on failure it feeds the validation errors back to the Brain and lets it retry, up to `max_correction_attempts`; if still failing after that, it escalates to a human rather than silently accepting a non-conforming answer. | Turns "Answer generated" into "this is what success looks like, checked" — the model called out explicitly in an earlier round as the most important piece of this whole design. |

### Tested
- **Not** tested through a live Brain loop run — this sandbox's network allowlist doesn't include `ollama.carai.agency`, so a real end-to-end LLM call isn't reachable from here. Flagging this plainly rather than skipping the test silently.
- Instead, tested the two new mechanisms directly, in isolation, with real assertions:
  - `AgentIdentity.delegate()`: created a ROOT identity, delegated to an ASSISTANT-tier child (confirmed capabilities correctly narrowed to the ASSISTANT tier, confirmed `delegation_chain == [parent.agent_id]`), then delegated again to a grandchild with an explicit `sub_caps` restriction (confirmed capabilities narrowed further to exactly the requested subset, confirmed `delegation_chain` carries both ancestors in order).
  - `ExpectedOutcome.validate()`: ran a schema requiring `status`/`summary` fields against four inputs — fully valid JSON (passed), JSON missing a required field (correctly failed, correct error), JSON with a wrong field type (correctly failed, correct error), and a non-JSON string (correctly failed with a clear reason). All four produced the expected pass/fail result.
- Full app restart with these changes loaded — booted cleanly, no import errors.
- Regression check on Session 1/2 functionality (files/git/comms routes) — all still working after this session's changes, plus confirmed via a live API call that the new `delegation_chain` field now actually appears in `GET /api/governance/ucip/identity`'s response with zero changes needed to that route (it just serializes whatever `AgentIdentity.to_dict()` returns).

### Known follow-ups
- The `mark_complete` validation logic is written and unit-tested at the schema-validator level, but has not been exercised through an actual live Brain decision loop (blocked on network access to the configured LLM endpoint from this environment, not a code issue). Worth a live test the next time this runs somewhere with access to `ollama.carai.agency` or another configured provider.
- `AgentIdentity.delegate()` exists and is tested, but nothing in the codebase calls it yet — Workers (Stage 3, not started) are the natural first real caller, when a Worker persona needs to sub-delegate to another Worker.

## Session 4 — Stage 1: Memory's internal division (Episodic/Semantic/Working/Long-term/Tenant/Learning)

**Goal:** close the last structural gap flagged in the Master Plan — Memory
was one flat, undifferentiated SQLite table (`memories`), used only for
raw chat history. No separation between conversation turns, distilled
lessons, facts, or ephemeral task state. Also found along the way:
`brain/autoresearch.py` kept its own entirely separate lesson-storage
mechanism (a per-session JSONL file), disconnected from Memory altogether
— exactly the kind of fragmentation this division scheme exists to fix.

### Design decision
Per the Master Plan's explicit instruction, this is **logical division via
a `kind` column, not separate services or tables** — keeps the Micro Acer
profile's resource footprint unchanged. The one exception is **Working**
memory, which is deliberately a *different mechanism* (a separate
in-process TTL'd dict, not a database row at all) — persisting ephemeral
scratch state would be a bug, not a feature, so it doesn't belong in the
same table as everything meant to be durable.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `memory/working.py` | `WorkingMemory` — singleton in-process TTL cache, keyed by `(session_id, key)`. `clear_session()` wipes a session's scratch space on task completion; `sweep_expired()` for proactive housekeeping. Explicitly documented as in-process-only, same scope note as `communications/bus.py`. |

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `memory/store.py` | Added `kind` and `tenant_id` columns to the SQLite `memories` table via a safe, idempotent migration (`_migrate_sqlite_divisions()`) that runs on every startup and defaults existing rows to `kind='episodic'`. `save()`/`recall()` gained optional `kind`/`tenant_id` params — `recall()` defaults to no filter (searches everything, exactly matching pre-division behavior) so every existing caller keeps working unchanged. Added `save_learning()` convenience wrapper for the Learning division. Threaded `kind`/`tenant_id` through the Supabase and ChromaDB branches too (best-effort — not tested here since neither is configured in this environment, only SQLite is exercised). | This is the actual division-scheme implementation: Episodic/Semantic/Long-term/Tenant/Learning are now real, queryable, isolated-by-default `kind` values on one table; Vector isn't a separate kind — it's an access pattern (the existing embedding-based recall path) that any kind can use. |
| `brain/autoresearch.py` | At the end of a session's `run()`, now writes one distilled lesson into Memory's Learning division via `save_learning()` — separate from (not replacing) the existing full JSONL trace. | Gives the Learning division a real caller instead of shipping as unused infrastructure. The full trace stays for debugging/replay; the lesson is the short, queryable takeaway a future Evolution pass or another Worker could actually recall. |

### Tested
- **Migration backward-compatibility, against real pre-existing data, not a fresh DB:** manually inserted a legacy-shaped row (no `kind`/`tenant_id` columns existed yet) directly into the actual `data/memory.db` this project has been using since Session 1, then ran the new migration against it. Confirmed the row survived intact and was correctly defaulted to `kind='episodic'`, and confirmed the new columns exist afterward.
- **Division isolation:** saved one entry each as `episodic`, `learning`, and `semantic` for the same user, all containing/near the word "blue" or related terms where relevant. Confirmed a `kind='episodic'` search does NOT return the learning entry and vice versa, and confirmed an unfiltered search (`kind=None`) returns across all of them — proving both the isolation and the backward-compatible default work correctly.
- **`save_learning()` end-to-end:** wrote a lesson, recalled it by `kind='learning'`, got it back correctly.
- **`WorkingMemory`:** TTL expiry (set with `ttl_s=1`, confirmed present immediately, confirmed gone after 1.2s), `clear_session()` (confirmed it wipes only its own session's keys, leaves other sessions' keys untouched), `sweep_expired()` (confirmed it proactively removes already-expired entries).
- **Live API regression test:** full server restart, then `POST /api/memory/save` and `POST /api/memory/search` through the actual running HTTP API (not just the Python module directly) — confirmed the response now includes `"kind": "episodic"` on real data, and confirmed Files/Git/Governance-identity routes from Sessions 1–3 still work unchanged after this session's schema migration.

### Known follow-ups
- Supabase/ChromaDB branches of `kind`/`tenant_id` threading are written but **not tested** — this environment only exercises the SQLite backend (no Supabase/ChromaDB configured here). Worth a real test the next time this runs somewhere with one of those configured.
- `tenant_id` is plumbed through end-to-end but nothing sets it to a real value yet — there's no multi-tenant concept wired up in CaraiOS v3 today (that's Admin ESA's job, per the master plan's eventual integration). The column exists and is ready; actually scoping queries by tenant is Stage 7 (Enterprise Features) territory, not done now.
- `WorkingMemory` exists and is tested but nothing in the codebase calls it yet, same situation as `AgentIdentity.delegate()` from Session 3 — the natural first caller is the Brain loop needing to stash mid-task scratch state, which hasn't been wired in.

---

## Session 5 — Stage 1: LLM Router audit against the original requirement

**Goal:** audit `brain/llm.py`/`brain/endpoints.py` against what was actually
asked for — OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Ollama-compatible endpoints,
OpenRouter free models, HuggingFace free models, and DeepSeek — rather than
against the 6-provider table from an earlier planning round (that table
included Anthropic as *my own* addition, not something requested; noting
that distinction so this audit doesn't conflate the two).

### Audit findings
| Requirement | Status before this session | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI-compatible generic endpoint | ✅ Covered | `custom:<id>` mechanism via `EndpointRegistry`/`CustomEndpointClient` handles any OpenAI-compatible server |
| Ollama-compatible | ✅ Covered | Native `_ollama()` method |
| OpenRouter free models | ✅ Covered | Native, `list_models()` even flags which models are free via the `:free` suffix convention |
| DeepSeek | ✅ Covered | Native `_openai_compat()` call with DeepSeek's base URL |
| **HuggingFace free models** | ⚠️ **Gap** | Only reachable indirectly via the generic `custom:` mechanism, which requires the user to already know HF's correct OpenAI-compatible router URL and model-suffix convention — not a first-class, named provider the way OpenRouter/DeepSeek are. Verified via a live web search (this codebase's HF integration predates or never accounted for it) that HF's actual current OpenAI-compatible endpoint is `https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions`, requiring a real HF token even for free-tier models (not anonymous access), with model IDs needing a provider-routing suffix like `:auto`. |
| — | **Bug found, unrelated to the above** | `BrainLLM._all_providers()` imported `EndpointRegistry`, instantiated it, and then did nothing with it — the comment admitted "we don't have user context here," but the method took no `user_id` parameter to fix that. Net effect: the automatic multi-provider fallback in `decide()`/`stream_chat()` **never** included any custom endpoint, contradicting what the surrounding code implied was intended. |

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `core/config.py` | Added `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`, `HUGGINGFACE_BASE_URL` (defaults to the real router URL confirmed above), `HUGGINGFACE_DEFAULT_MODEL`. Added `huggingface` to `available_providers` (gated on the key being set, same pattern as every other provider). |
| `brain/llm.py` | Added `huggingface` to `_call()`'s dispatch, reusing the existing `_openai_compat()` helper since HF's router genuinely is OpenAI-compatible — no new request-building code needed. Added a curated model list for `list_models(provider="huggingface")` (HF has no simple "list what's free" API the way OpenRouter does, so this is a maintained short-list of well-supported chat models, not a live catalog). **Fixed the `_all_providers()` bug**: `BrainLLM` now accepts an optional `user_id`; when present, that user's enabled custom endpoints are correctly included in the automatic fallback chain; when absent, they're correctly excluded (documented as a deliberate scope limit — no user context means no safe way to guess whose endpoints to include — rather than the previous silent no-op regardless of whether a user_id existed to check). |
| `core/loop.py` | `BrainExecutionLoop._loop()` now passes `user_id=self.user_id` when constructing `BrainLLM`, so the Brain's automatic fallback in actual production use includes that user's custom endpoints, not just built-in providers. |

### Tested
- Full app restart with all changes — clean boot, no import errors.
- **Provider gating**: confirmed via the live `/api/health` endpoint that `huggingface` is correctly absent from `available_providers` with no key set, and correctly appears once `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` is set in `.env` and the server restarted.
- **Model listing**: confirmed via the live `/api/models` endpoint that the curated HuggingFace model list appears once the provider is available.
- **Request-shape verification**: since this sandbox can't reach `router.huggingface.co` (network allowlist), intercepted the outbound `httpx` call at the Python level instead of letting it hit the network — confirmed the HF dispatch path builds a request to exactly `https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions`, with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and the correct default model in the payload, before the (expected, intentional) connection failure.
- **`_all_providers()` fix, three cases**: registered a real custom endpoint for a test user in the actual `EndpointRegistry` (SQLite-backed, not mocked) and confirmed (a) with no `user_id` supplied, no custom endpoint appears in the fallback list, (b) with that user's `user_id` supplied, their custom endpoint correctly appears, (c) with a *different* user's `user_id`, the first user's endpoint correctly does NOT appear — proving the fix is both functional and properly scoped, not just "now it shows something."
- Full regression sweep across every route built in Sessions 1–4 (files, git, identity/delegation, memory division, provider health) — all still working after this session's changes.

### Known follow-ups
- The HuggingFace curated model list is a maintained short-list, not a live query — HF doesn't expose a simple "list free-tier chat models" API the way OpenRouter does. Worth revisiting if HF adds one, or if specific models the user wants aren't on the curated list (the generic `custom:` endpoint mechanism remains available as a manual workaround for any HF model not on the list).
- HF's "free" tier is rate-limited monthly credits attached to a real account token, not anonymous/keyless access — worth being upfront about that distinction versus OpenRouter's more permissive free-model access, since both were requested under the same "free" framing originally.
- Anthropic/Claude as a provider was flagged in an earlier planning round as a possible addition but was never part of the original request — not added here to avoid scope creep beyond what was actually asked for. Straightforward to add later if wanted (would need its own `_anthropic()` method since Anthropic's `/v1/messages` API isn't OpenAI-compatible — different message/system-prompt shape — so it can't reuse `_openai_compat()` the way DeepSeek/OpenRouter/HuggingFace do).

---

## Session 6 — Stage 1: DevOS frontend rewiring (closes out Stage 1)

**Goal:** point DevOS's actual frontend (`frontend-v2/src/services/api.js`)
at CaraiOS v3's real routes instead of the retired Node backend, per the
Session 1 consolidation decision. Every component in `frontend-v2` calls
through this one file, so rewiring it here (rather than touching every
component individually) is the correct leverage point.

### Two real architecture mismatches, handled explicitly rather than papered over
1. **Auth**: DevOS's original `api.js` pulled a token from a Supabase
   session. CaraiOS has its own JWT auth (bcrypt + JWT, no Supabase
   involved). Replaced with `login()`/`logout()`/`getToken()` backed by
   `localStorage`.
2. **Projects**: every CaraiOS files/git/terminal route is scoped to a
   `project_id` (`/api/files/{project_id}/...`); DevOS's original calls had
   no project concept at all (one flat workspace, no id in any URL).
   Introduced `getCurrentProject()`/`setCurrentProject()`, defaulting to a
   fixed `"default"` project id, so every existing component call site
   keeps working with zero changes while the backend underneath is
   correctly multi-project.

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `execution/vcs.py`, `api/routes/vcs.py`, `governance/tool_contracts.py` | **Real gap found while mapping the frontend's git panel calls, closed before touching the frontend**: `diff` and `discard` didn't exist in `GitService` at all — Session 1 built status/init/stage/commit/push/pull/checkout/log but not these two, which the DevOS git panel actually calls. Added both, with `discard` routed through the same HITL gate as `delete_file` (irreversible for uncommitted work, same trust-model reasoning as everything else this project has built). |
| `frontend-v2/src/services/api.js` | Full rewrite of the request layer. Kept every original exported method name/signature so **no component needs to change** — the translation from old calls to new CaraiOS routes happens entirely inside this one file. Original backed up to `api.js.bak` alongside it. |

### What's genuinely wired now (real backend, real routes)
Files (tree/read/write/create/rename/delete), Git (status/init/stage/unstage/commit/push/pull/checkout/discard/diff), a new Terminal section DevOS's `api.js` never had before (buffered `runCommand` + a `openStreamingTerminal()` WebSocket factory), Governance/UCIP (identity, capabilities, HITL pending/approve/deny, metrics/traces), a new `subscribeToEvents()` for the Communications SSE stream, and Flow (script list; `flowStats` computed client-side since CaraiOS has no dedicated stats aggregate endpoint).

### What's explicitly NOT implemented — and says so loudly instead of faking success
`streamChat`, `complete`, `streamEdit`, `streamExplain` (inline AI features — Stage 2, Cognitive System, not built), `getIndexStatus`/`reindex`/`searchFiles` (codebase indexing, not built), `streamAgent` (autonomous runs exist server-side in `core/loop.py` but aren't exposed as a streaming route), `composerPlan`/`streamComposerExecute`/`composerApply` (multi-file Composer — Stage 3, Workers, not built), `searchExtensions`/`featuredExtensions`/`extensionDetails` (extension marketplace — Stage 8 packaging, not built), `saveSettings`/`patchSettings` (CaraiOS's settings route is read-only today), and `gitAddRemote` (a pre-existing gap in DevOS's own original `api.js` too — never implemented on either side, not something this rewiring introduced). Every one of these throws a specific, named error explaining what's missing and pointing back to this record, rather than returning empty data that would look indistinguishable from "no results" instead of "not built yet."

### Tested — with real Node, not just read through
This sandbox has Node 22 available, so rather than reasoning about the JavaScript by inspection, it was actually run:
- Built a minimal `localStorage` polyfill (Node has no browser storage APIs) and ran the actual `api.js` file as a real ES module against the live CaraiOS server.
- **Full round trip through the real JS client**: login → token stored → `setCurrentProject` → `getTree`/`writeFile`/`readFile` (confirmed content matches) → `gitStatus`/`gitDiff` → `runCommand` (confirmed the terminal sees the exact file the Files API just wrote, proving both share the same project directory) → `ucipIdentity` (confirmed `delegation_chain` present, tying back to Session 3) → `flowScripts`/`flowStats`.
- **Bug found and fixed via this same test, not before it**: the first version of `subscribeToEvents()` only listened via `es.onmessage`, which only fires for unnamed SSE frames. The backend (correctly, per SSE conventions) sends *named* events (`event: hitl.pending`, `event: hitl.resolved`) — so the first version silently received nothing, ever. Fixed by registering `addEventListener` for each known event type, and exposing the raw `EventSource` as an escape hatch for event types this file doesn't know about yet.
- **Full HITL delete flow through the real JS client, with live events**, using Node 22's `--experimental-eventsource` flag: wrote a file, subscribed to the event stream, fired `deleteFile()` (which blocks server-side), confirmed the pending request was visible both via `getPendingHitl()` *and* arrived live over SSE as a `hitl.pending` event, approved it via `approveHitl()`, confirmed the delete promise then resolved with `{deleted: true}`, and confirmed a `hitl.resolved` event arrived over SSE afterward. Six total events were received across the test run, including replayed history from earlier sessions' HITL activity — proving the bounded replay buffer from Session 2 works exactly as designed for a genuinely new subscriber.
- Confirmed the explicit not-implemented stubs throw clear, specific errors (tested `streamChat` directly) rather than failing in a way that would look like empty data.
- Full backend regression sweep after all of this — health/files/git/identity all still correct.

### Known follow-ups
- No actual login-screen UI component was built — `login()`/`logout()` exist and are tested at the `api.js` level, but nothing in `frontend-v2`'s components calls them yet. Wiring a real login form is the natural next step before this is usable end-to-end in a browser, not just from a Node test script.
- `downloadUrl()` is a documented half-measure — it points at the JSON `read` endpoint, which works for opening text files but is not a real binary file download. CaraiOS has no dedicated download endpoint yet; flagged rather than silently broken.
- Every "NOT YET IMPLEMENTED" method listed above is real, current scope for Stage 2 (Cognitive System) and Stage 3 (Workers) — this session intentionally didn't try to fake any of them just to make the method list look complete.
- This was tested with Node simulating the browser environment (via polyfills and Node 22's experimental EventSource), not an actual browser — worth a real browser smoke-test once there's a login screen to click through, since some browser-specific behaviors (CORS preflight, cookie handling, etc.) can't be fully exercised from Node.

## Stage 1 — Status

Every item from the original Stage 1 gap list is now built and tested:
IdentityContext extension ✅ (Session 3), Communications organ ✅ (Session 2),
Memory's internal division ✅ (Session 4), LLM Router audited and gapfixed ✅
(Session 5), Files/Git/Terminal APIs ✅ (Session 1), DevOS frontend rewired ✅
(Session 6, pending a real login-screen component and a browser smoke test).
Stage 2 (Cognitive System) is next per the Master Plan.

## Session 7 — Stage 2 kickoff: Cognitive System (goal decomposition + reflection)

**Goal:** `core/loop.py`'s `BrainExecutionLoop` was, before this session, a
flat ReAct loop only — think, act, observe, repeat, with no upfront
planning step and no qualitative self-critique (Session 3's
`expected_outcome_schema` check is structural — right shape — not
qualitative — right answer). This session added both, as explicit opt-in
capabilities rather than changing default loop behavior.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cognitive/decomposer.py` | `GoalDecomposer` — one LLM call that breaks a goal into an ordered, dependency-tagged subtask list (a small DAG: `id`, `description`, `depends_on`). Validates the DAG (no cycles, no references to unknown ids) and falls back to a single-subtask plan — logged, not silent — if the response is malformed or invalid. |
| `cognitive/reflector.py` | `Reflector` — one LLM call, after a `mark_complete`, that critiques the final answer against the original goal: does it actually satisfy what was asked, not just "is it shaped correctly." Returns `satisfied`/`issues`/`confidence`. A reflection that itself fails to parse defaults to `satisfied=True` (visibly flagged, not silently treated as a hard failure) — a flaky critique step shouldn't be able to deadlock otherwise-fine work. |

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `core/loop.py` | Added `StepType.PLAN` and `StepType.REFLECT`. Added `subtasks`/`reflections`/`reflection_correction_attempts`/`use_reflection` fields to `LoopState`. `run()` gained two **opt-in** parameters: `decompose_first=False` (runs `GoalDecomposer` before the main loop starts) and `use_reflection=False` (runs `Reflector` after each `mark_complete`, bounded to 2 correction attempts before escalating to a human — same pattern as Session 3's schema-validation exhaustion path). Both default off: this is a real behavior change (extra LLM calls, a second opinion gating completion) that callers should choose, not receive silently. | Closes the Stage 2 gap: the loop can now genuinely plan before acting and critique after acting, not just react step-by-step. |

### A real bug found and fixed via testing, not before it
The first version of `decompose_first` computed a real subtask plan and
logged it as a `PLAN` step for the audit trail — but never actually added
it to the `messages` list sent to the Brain. The decomposition happened,
was fully visible in `LoopState`, and had **zero effect on what the Brain
actually saw or did** — a plan computed and filed away, not used. Caught by
writing an integration test that checked whether the Brain's *actual
message context* contained the plan (not just whether `state.subtasks` was
populated), which is exactly the kind of gap a superficial test would miss.
Fixed by folding the plan into the seed messages inside `_loop()` itself,
then re-ran the exact same test to confirm the fix closed the gap.

### Tested
- **Full production-path integration test, not a reimplementation**: monkeypatched `BrainLLM.decide()`/`BrainLLM._call()` to return a scripted sequence, then ran a real `BrainExecutionLoop.run(..., use_reflection=True)` end to end. The Brain answered "Lyon" (wrong), Reflection correctly flagged it as unsatisfied with a specific issue, that critique was fed back into the Brain's actual context, the Brain revised to "Paris", Reflection accepted it, and the loop completed with the corrected answer — the full self-critique loop working through real production code, not a mock of it.
- **`GoalDecomposer`, four cases** with a fake brain returning canned responses: a well-formed 3-subtask plan (dependencies preserved correctly), malformed non-JSON text (fell back to a single atomic subtask, logged a warning, didn't crash), a dependency cycle (`t1→t2→t1`, correctly detected and rejected rather than silently accepted), and a reference to a nonexistent subtask id (also correctly caught).
- **`decompose_first` integration**, including the bug-fix verification above: confirmed subtasks land on `LoopState.subtasks`, confirmed a `PLAN` step is logged with the human-readable plan text, and — after the fix — confirmed the Brain's actual `messages` list contains the plan content, not just the audit log.
- Full app restart after all changes — clean boot, no import errors.
- Full regression sweep across every route from Sessions 1–6 (files, git, identity/delegation, memory division, provider health) — all still working.

### Known follow-ups
- Neither `decompose_first` nor `use_reflection` is wired to any API route yet — they're real, tested capabilities on `BrainExecutionLoop.run()`, but nothing in `api/routes/loop.py` exposes them as request parameters yet. Next natural step: add them as optional fields on whatever request body `POST /api/loop/...` accepts.
- `decompose_first` currently produces a plan for a *single* Brain to work through sequentially — it does not dispatch different subtasks to different Workers in parallel. That's correct for now (Workers don't exist yet — Stage 3), but worth remembering this isn't "multi-agent coordination" yet, just "single-agent planning."
- No live LLM was reachable from this sandbox (same network-allowlist limitation as Session 3), so all testing used dependency-injected fake `BrainLLM` responses rather than a real model. The logic paths are genuinely exercised; the actual quality of a real LLM's decomposition/reflection output is unverified here.
- `Reflector`'s critique quality is only as good as whatever LLM is configured to run it — a weak or same-tier model reflecting on its own work has real, known limitations (it can rubber-stamp its own mistakes). Worth considering routing reflection to a different/stronger provider than the one that produced the answer, once multiple providers are actually in use — not implemented now, just flagging the idea.

## Session 8 — Stage 3 kickoff: Workers (agency-agents personas become real)

**Goal:** `brain/agents/__init__.py`'s `AGENT_LIBRARY` held 16 real persona
definitions (ported from msitarzewski/agency-agents, MIT — confirmed clean
of AGPL/Odysseus contamination all the way back in the original repo audit)
but **nothing in the codebase invoked them**. They were pure data. This
session built the runtime wrapper that turns a persona into an actually
invocable, properly-governed Worker.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `workers/runtime.py` | `WorkerRuntime.run(slug, goal, requester_identity)` — the actual Worker invocation path. `resolve_worker_capabilities()` maps a persona's declared `tools` (already named after real `ACTION_TO_CAP` keys — no separate mapping table needed) to UCIP capability strings, dropping unrecognized tool names with a logged warning rather than failing the whole persona. |
| `api/routes/workers.py` | `GET /api/workers` (list), `GET /api/workers/{slug}` (detail), `POST /api/workers/{slug}/run/sync` and `POST /api/workers/{slug}/run` (SSE streaming, same shape as the existing `/api/loop/run`). |

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `core/loop.py` | `BrainExecutionLoop.__init__` gained optional `agent_identity` (use a pre-built identity instead of always minting a fresh one) and `persona_prompt` (composed with `BRAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, not swapped in — the base prompt is what establishes the JSON action-calling protocol the loop's parser expects; a persona alone doesn't know about `mark_complete`). | This is what makes a Worker actually run under a *delegated* identity instead of a freshly-minted full-trust one, and actually sound like its persona instead of the generic Brain. |
| `app.py` | Registered the `workers` router. | |

### A real, load-bearing bug found and fixed — in Session 3's code, three sessions later
`AgentIdentity.delegate()` (built in Session 3) had never had a real caller
until this session. Its first real use — a ROOT-trust user delegating to a
Worker with explicit `sub_caps` — immediately produced an **empty
capability set** instead of the requested capabilities. Root cause: `"*"`
is used as a literal wildcard token in `TRUST_LEVEL_CAPS`/`capabilities`
sets, and the original delegation logic did a plain set-intersection
(`inheritable & sub_caps`) — which correctly handles the case where the
*parent's own capabilities* contain `"*"`, but not the case where the
*child's trust tier* (`tier_caps`) contains `"*"`, since `"*"` doesn't
equal any specific capability string in a set intersection. Every Worker
delegated from a ROOT or AUTONOMOUS-tier requester with an explicit
`sub_caps` request — exactly the Worker use case — silently got nothing.
Fixed by checking each requested capability against both sides via a
`_permits()` helper that treats `"*"` as "matches anything," rather than
relying on literal set intersection. Re-ran every one of Session 3's
original delegation tests plus new wildcard-specific cases to confirm the
fix was both correct and non-regressive.

This is worth sitting with for a second: Session 3's unit tests were real
and passed, and the code was reviewed — but they only exercised
`sub_caps=None` and non-wildcard parents, because there was no real caller
yet to exercise the actual Worker-shaped case. It shipped a subtly broken
core mechanism for three sessions before its first real use caught it.
Noting this not to relitigate Session 3, but because it's a genuine
instance of the "known follow-up" pattern this record has been flagging
all along actually mattering — untested-because-uncalled code is a real
risk, not a formality.

### Tested
- **Capability resolution**: confirmed `fullstack-engineer`'s declared tools map to exactly the right UCIP capability strings; confirmed an unknown/fake tool name is dropped with a warning rather than breaking the persona's other, valid tools.
- **The bug, before and after**: reproduced the empty-set bug directly, fixed `delegate()`, then confirmed a ROOT requester delegating to `fullstack-engineer` now gets exactly `{search.web, execution.bash, execution.python}` — the persona's exact declared set, no more, no less.
- **Trust-narrowing still holds after the fix**: a READ_ONLY-trust requester delegating to the same Worker correctly receives only `{search.web}` (the one capability they already had that overlaps the persona's wants) — proving the fix didn't accidentally reopen the "Worker exceeds requester's own trust" hole the delegation model exists to prevent.
- **Full production-path integration test**: monkeypatched `BrainLLM.decide()` and ran a real `WorkerRuntime().run("fullstack-engineer", ...)` end to end — confirmed the persona's actual system prompt text ("Senior Full-Stack Engineer") reached the Brain's real message context, confirmed the delegated identity's `delegation_chain` correctly names the requester, confirmed capabilities matched exactly.
- **Live API test, not just Python-level**: full server restart, then `GET /api/workers` (all 16 personas), `GET /api/workers/{slug}` (detail), 404 on an unknown slug, and `POST /api/workers/code-reviewer/run/sync` — which correctly built and returned a properly-narrowed delegated identity (`{search.web}`, matching `code-reviewer`'s one declared tool) and failed *cleanly* on the LLM call (no live Ollama reachable from this sandbox, same limitation as every prior session) rather than crashing, returning `"decision": "abort"` with a clear message instead of a 500 error.
- Full regression sweep across every route from Sessions 1–7 — all still working after this session's changes, including the `AgentIdentity.delegate()` bugfix.

### Known follow-ups
- Only 16 of `agency-agents`' 300+ personas have been ported into `AGENT_LIBRARY` so far — this session built the runtime *mechanism*, not the full roster. Porting the remaining ~284 is bulk data work, not architecture work, and can happen incrementally without touching `workers/runtime.py` again.
- No live LLM test was possible (same network-allowlist limitation noted in every session since Session 3) — the `/run/sync` route was confirmed to work correctly up to and including the LLM call attempt, but a real model's actual persona-appropriate output is unverified here.
- The SSE-streaming `/run` variant was wired following the exact pattern of the existing `/api/loop/run` route but wasn't independently tested this session (no time remaining in this pass) — worth a dedicated test next time, since it's new code, not just a copy of already-tested code.
- Multi-worker coordination (one Worker delegating to another, or a Cognitive-System coordinator dispatching several Workers in parallel for a decomposed plan from Session 7) still doesn't exist — this session enables a *single* Worker to run under proper delegation, which is the necessary foundation, but not yet the coordination layer itself.

---

## Session 9 — Multi-worker coordination, plus two more real bugs found by exercising it

**Goal:** connect Session 7's `GoalDecomposer` to Session 8's `WorkerRuntime`
— a decomposed plan was still being worked through by one generalist Brain
sequentially, which Session 7's own notes flagged explicitly. This session
builds the actual dispatch layer.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cognitive/coordinator.py` | `Coordinator.run_plan(subtasks, requester_identity)` — runs a decomposed plan's subtasks in dependency-respecting waves (everany subtask with no unmet dependencies runs concurrently with its wave-mates via `asyncio.gather`), routing each subtask to whichever Worker persona best matches its description via `brain.agents.get_best_agent_for_goal` (which already existed, used only by `brain/builder.py` — same "real infrastructure, no caller yet" pattern noted in Session 8, now given a second real caller). Falls back to the generalist Brain for a subtask no persona fits well, rather than forcing a bad match. Defends against an unresolvable dependency (a cycle or dangling reference that somehow bypassed `GoalDecomposer`'s own validation) by failing just that subtask instead of hanging forever. |

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `api/routes/workers.py` | Added `POST /api/workers/plan/run` — decompose-then-coordinate in one call. | Exposes the Coordinator as a real endpoint, not just a Python-level capability. |
| `core/loop.py`, `workers/runtime.py` | See "bugs found" below. | |

### Two more real bugs found by giving old code its first real workout
**1. Redundant `BrainLLM` construction, found while investigating a concurrency test that didn't behave as expected.** `BrainExecutionLoop.run()` unconditionally constructed a `BrainLLM` instance for planning purposes (`brain_for_planning`) even when `decompose_first=False` — the default, common case — and then constructed a *second*, separate `BrainLLM` for the actual loop. The Reflection code path (Session 7) constructed a *third* one, despite already having a working `brain` instance passed into `_loop()` as a parameter. Each `BrainLLM()` construction costs real time (~30ms, from `httpx.AsyncClient`'s connection-pool/SSL setup) — pure waste on every single `run()` call when reflection/decomposition weren't even used. Found because the Coordinator's dependency-wave concurrency test showed same-wave subtasks starting ~70ms apart instead of near-simultaneously; traced it down component by component (Memory, RateLimiter, each governance class, `BrainExecutionLoop.__init__` cold-start, and finally `BrainLLM()` itself) rather than guessing. Fixed by constructing exactly one `BrainLLM` per `run()` call and threading it through to both the decomposition step and the reflection step. Re-ran Session 7's reflection test afterward to confirm the fix was behaviorally identical, just faster.
**2. Duplicated persona-prompt composition.** Session 8 wrote its own ad-hoc string concatenation to combine a persona's prompt with `BRAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, without noticing `brain/agents/__init__.py` already had a more complete function for exactly this (`build_agent_system_prompt` — includes an "ACTIVE AGENT" header and an explicit tools list, already used by `brain/builder.py`). Consolidated `workers/runtime.py` to use the real one instead of maintaining two competing implementations of the same composition.

### Tested
- **Routing correctness**: a 4-subtask plan (audit → frontend + backend in parallel → docs, with a diamond dependency shape) correctly routed each subtask to `code-reviewer`, `frontend-developer`, `backend-engineer`, and `technical-writer` respectively, based purely on each subtask's description text.
- **Dependency-respecting concurrency, honestly measured**: confirmed the two independent subtasks (frontend, backend) started within ~35ms of each other (real, meaningful overlap — not full serialization, which would show a ~50ms+ gap matching the fake work duration) and confirmed the dependent subtask (docs) only started after *both* of its dependencies had actually finished, not just started.
- **Lineage**: confirmed each dispatched subtask's delegated identity has a `delegation_chain` correctly tracing back to the requester who kicked off the whole plan.
- **Defensive handling**: manually constructed a `Subtask` with a dependency on a nonexistent id (bypassing `GoalDecomposer`'s own DAG validation, simulating a bad plan injected from elsewhere) — confirmed the Coordinator's own independent defense caught it and failed just that subtask with a clear reason, rather than hanging.
- **A real routing bug, found and fixed via testing the actual HTTP endpoint, not the Python function directly**: the new `POST /api/workers/plan/run` route was initially registered *after* the existing `POST /api/workers/{slug}/run` route in the file. FastAPI/Starlette matches routes in registration order, so a request to `/plan/run` was being matched against `/{slug}/run` with `slug="plan"` instead, returning `"No worker persona 'plan'"` — the coordinator endpoint was silently unreachable. Caught immediately by testing the live route rather than assuming route registration order doesn't matter. Fixed by moving the static route before the dynamic one, then confirmed both the fixed coordinator route and the existing named-worker routes work correctly afterward.
- Live end-to-end test of `POST /api/workers/plan/run` against the real server: correctly decomposed the goal, correctly routed the resulting subtask to `technical-writer`, correctly built a delegation chain, and failed cleanly on the LLM call itself (no live Ollama reachable from this sandbox, same limitation noted every session since Session 3) rather than crashing.
- Full regression sweep across every route from Sessions 1–8 — all still working after this session's changes.

### Known follow-ups
- No live LLM was reachable from this sandbox (same limitation as every session since Session 3) — the Coordinator's actual persona-routing quality with a real model's real subtask descriptions (as opposed to the hand-written test descriptions used here) is unverified.
- `get_best_agent_for_goal`'s keyword-matching is a simple ordered-rules heuristic, not a learned or LLM-driven router — it will misroute subtasks whose wording doesn't hit any keyword, falling back to the generalist Brain in that case (tested and correct behavior), but a smarter router is a legitimate future improvement, not attempted here.
- Worker-to-Worker delegation (a Worker's own task spawning a further-delegated sub-Worker, as opposed to the Coordinator dispatching from one top-level plan) is explicitly not built — `coordinator.py`'s docstring flags this as a smaller, separate extension of the same `delegation_chain` mechanism.
- This session's bug-hunting habit is worth naming directly: two real, load-bearing bugs (Session 8's wildcard delegation bug, this session's redundant-construction and duplicated-composition issues) were found not by reviewing code but by giving already-written, already-"tested" code its first genuinely new kind of exercise. The pattern holding across three sessions now: code with no real caller, or only tested in a narrow shape, is a real risk sitting in the system regardless of how carefully it was written the first time.

---

## Session 10 — Worker-to-Worker delegation

**Goal:** close the last flagged Stage 3 gap — a Worker's own task spawning
a further-delegated sub-Worker, as opposed to Session 9's Coordinator
dispatching from one top-level plan. `governance/ucip.py` already had
`"spawn_agent": "ucip:agent.spawn"` in `ACTION_TO_CAP`, and `ucip:agent.spawn`
was already in `HITL_REQUIRED_CAPS` — the capability and its safety gate
existed, but (same pattern as Sessions 8 and 9) nothing dispatched it.

### Modified files
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `governance/tool_contracts.py` | Registered a real `spawn_agent` tool contract (`input_fields=["worker","goal"]`, `is_reversible=False`, 180s timeout since a sub-worker runs its own full loop). | Without this, `ToolValidator.validate()` would reject every `spawn_agent` call before it ever reached the UCIP gate — the capability mapping alone wasn't enough. |
| `core/loop.py` | Added `spawn_agent` dispatch: parses `{"worker": slug, "goal": ...}` from `action_input`, checks a depth limit (`MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH = 3`, measured via `len(self.agent.delegation_chain)` — reusing Session 3's existing, already-tracked lineage rather than adding new state), then calls `WorkerRuntime().run(worker_slug, sub_goal, self.agent, ...)` — critically passing **`self.agent`** (the *current* loop's own identity) as the requester, not the original top-level requester, so delegation genuinely chains (A→B→C) rather than every spawned Worker fanning out from the same root. The sub-worker's result is fed back into the calling loop's messages as an observation, same pattern as `search_web`/`recall_memory`. | This is the actual mechanism. |
| `brain/agents/__init__.py` | Granted `product-manager` the `spawn_agent` tool — the one persona among the current 16 whose actual job description (coordinating specialists' work) fits delegation. Documented explicitly that most personas should NOT get this by default; a focused individual-contributor persona should stay a leaf-level executor. | See "a real bug" below — this wasn't optional, it's what made delegation possible at all for any real Worker. |

### A real bug, and the false-positive test that almost hid it
The first version of this session's test used `fullstack-engineer` as the
delegating Worker and only asserted on the final answer string — which
came back looking correct (`"done with sub-worker help"`) even though the
actual delegation had been **silently denied**. Root cause: `fullstack-engineer`'s
declared tools (`write_python`, `write_bash`, `search_web`) don't include
`spawn_agent`, so its delegated identity correctly never received
`ucip:agent.spawn` — the UCIP gate correctly issued a hard `DENY` (visible
only in a stderr log line, not in the test's return value), the loop
correctly re-prompted the Brain, and the *second* canned test response
(`mark_complete`) fired regardless, producing a final answer that looked
like success. The test was checking "did the loop finish with a plausible
string" instead of "did delegation actually happen" — exactly the kind of
gap a canned/scripted test can hide if the assertions aren't specific
enough. Caught by noticing the DENY line in stderr output during a routine
test run, not by the assertions themselves failing. Rewritten to verify
delegation actually occurred by checking that the sub-worker's *own,
distinctly-different* system prompt genuinely executed (not just that some
plausible-sounding text came back), and fixed the actual root cause by
giving `product-manager` — a persona whose job is coordination — the
capability, rather than papering over it by loosening the depth limit or
some other unrelated change.

### Tested
- **Basic delegation through the generalist Brain** (ROOT trust, has `"*"`, so no persona-capability gap applies): confirmed `spawn_agent` correctly escalates to HITL (since `ucip:agent.spawn` is always HITL-gated), confirmed the sub-worker (`code-reviewer`) actually ran and its result reached the parent loop's context, confirmed the loop completed correctly afterward.
- **Depth-limit enforcement**: manually built an identity already three delegation-hops deep, confirmed `spawn_agent` is blocked before even attempting a sub-worker run, and confirmed the rejection reason reaches the Brain's actual message context (not just logged) so it can adapt rather than being stuck.
- **Malformed input handling**: a non-JSON `action_input` is caught and fed back as a clear format-correction message rather than crashing the loop.
- **The real, verified case — Worker-to-Worker, not just Brain-to-Worker**: `product-manager` (now correctly holding `ucip:agent.spawn` via its own delegated identity) successfully spawned `technical-writer` mid-task; confirmed via the sub-worker's distinctly different system prompt that it genuinely executed its own separate loop, not a reused canned response; confirmed the sub-worker's real output reached the delegating Worker's context and the final answer correctly reflected it.
- Full server restart and regression sweep across every route from Sessions 1–9 — all still working; confirmed via the live `/api/workers` endpoint that `product-manager`'s tool list now correctly includes `spawn_agent`.

### Known follow-ups
- Only `product-manager` currently has `spawn_agent` — a deliberate, narrow choice for this session to prove the mechanism correctly, not a comprehensive pass over which of the (eventual) hundreds of personas should coordinate vs. execute. That's a real, ongoing content decision as more personas get ported, not a one-time fix.
- `MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH = 3` is a reasonable-guess constant, not derived from any load testing or real usage pattern — worth revisiting once there's real traffic to observe.
- No live LLM was reachable from this sandbox (same limitation noted every session since Session 3) — depth-limit and malformed-input handling are logic-level guarantees that hold regardless of model quality, but a real model's judgment about *when* to delegate vs. do the work itself is unverified here.
- The near-miss with the false-positive test is worth carrying forward as a habit, not just a one-time lesson: asserting on "the loop finished with plausible-looking output" is a weaker test than asserting on "the specific mechanism under test actually fired," and the gap between those two is exactly where a real, live-traffic-breaking bug could have shipped unnoticed.

## Session 11 — DevOS frontend: Workers wiring

**Goal:** close the frontend gap flagged since Session 6 and repeated in
Sessions 8-10 — Stage 3's real Worker infrastructure (list/detail/run,
Worker-to-Worker delegation, multi-worker coordination) had no client-side
code to call it. `api.js` predated Workers existing at all.

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend-v2/src/services/api.js` | Added `workersApi`: `listWorkers()`, `getWorker(slug)`, `runWorkerSync(slug, goal, opts)`, `streamWorker(slug, goal, opts)` (an async generator parsing the SSE-over-POST stream from `POST /api/workers/{slug}/run` — EventSource can't be used directly since it only supports GET, so this parses the raw `fetch` streaming body instead), and `runCoordinatedPlan(goal, opts)` (Session 9's decompose-and-dispatch endpoint). Updated the old `streamAgent` not-implemented stub to stop claiming autonomous agent runs don't exist server-side — they do now, under the Worker model — and point at the real replacements instead. |

### Tested — real Node client against the real live server, same discipline as Session 6
- `listWorkers()`: confirmed all 16 personas come back correctly.
- `getWorker("product-manager")`: confirmed the client sees Session 10's `spawn_agent` grant live, through the real HTTP round trip, not a cached assumption.
- `runWorkerSync()`: confirmed the delegated identity's capabilities come through the JS client exactly narrowed as expected (`code-reviewer` → exactly `["ucip:search.web"]`), and the call fails cleanly (no live Ollama reachable from this sandbox, same limitation every session since Session 3) rather than throwing an unhandled error.
- `runCoordinatedPlan()`: confirmed the client reaches the real Coordinator route and gets back a structured `subtasks`/`results` response.
- `streamWorker()`: confirmed the async generator correctly parses a real SSE-over-POST byte stream (buffering partial chunks across `reader.read()` calls, splitting on blank-line-delimited SSE frames) and terminates cleanly on the stream's final `done` event.
- `streamAgent()`: confirmed it still throws a clear not-implemented error, now correctly pointing at `streamWorker`/`runCoordinatedPlan` instead of claiming nothing exists.
- Full backend regression sweep after all of this — files/git/workers routes all still correct.

### Known follow-ups
- Still no actual React *component* renders any of this — `workersApi` is real and tested at the `api.js` level, same situation `login()`/`logout()` have been in since Session 6. A Workers panel/picker UI is the natural next step to make this clickable, not just callable.
- `streamWorker`'s SSE-over-POST parser handles the common case (well-formed `data: {...}\n\n` frames) but hasn't been tested against a real multi-step Worker run with several intermediate `step` events, only the immediate `done`/`error` terminal case — worth a deeper test once a live LLM is reachable and a Worker actually produces intermediate steps to stream.

---

## Session 12 — DevOS frontend: real UI components (Login screen + Workers panel)

**Goal:** close two UI gaps flagged since Session 6 — no login screen component existed (only a tested `login()` function nothing called), and no UI rendered any of Stage 3's Worker infrastructure (only a tested `workersApi` nothing rendered). This session builds both as real React components, and — new for this project — actually **renders** them with real React and jsdom rather than only checking JSX syntax, since a component can be syntactically perfect and still be functionally broken (exactly what happened partway through this session, see below).

### Testing approach, and why it changed this session
Every prior frontend session (6, 11) validated JS by running the real file with Node against the real live backend — solid for `api.js`, since it's plain functions with no rendering involved. Components are different: a syntax-valid, backend-correctly-wired component can still have a broken *render*. This sandbox has no CRA/webpack toolchain installed (`node_modules` doesn't exist for the frontend), so rather than skip render-testing or claim JSX syntax-validity was equivalent to "tested" (it isn't), this session installed a minimal, separate toolchain — `@babel/core` + `@babel/preset-react` for compilation, `react`/`react-dom`/`jsdom-global`/`zustand` for actual rendering — and built a small harness: mirror the component's real relative-import paths with controlled test doubles, compile with Babel, render with `react-dom/client` inside jsdom, and interact with real DOM events (`input`, `submit`, `click`) rather than calling component internals directly.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `components/auth/LoginScreen.jsx` + `.css` | A real, accessible login form: autofocused username field, labeled inputs with `autoComplete`, client-side validation before hitting the network, `role="alert"`/`aria-live` error announcement, disabled-while-submitting state, and the actual backend error text surfaced (not a generic fallback that would hide "wrong password" vs. "server down"). |
| `components/workers/WorkersPanel.jsx` + `.css` | Lists all Workers grouped by division (collapsible), flags which ones can delegate (`spawn_agent` badge), runs a single Worker with live streamed steps via `streamWorker()`, or switches to "Coordinated Plan" mode to hand a goal to the Session-9 Coordinator and render each subtask's routed Worker and result. |

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `services/api.js` | Added `verifySession()` — validates a stored token against the real `GET /api/auth/me` rather than trusting `localStorage` blindly (a stale token, e.g. from Session 6's flagged `JWT_SECRET`-resets-on-restart issue, now gets detected and cleared instead of silently causing every subsequent authenticated call to fail). |
| `store/useStore.js` | Added `user`/`isAuthenticated`/`authChecked`/`setUser`/`logout` auth state, and `workersOpen`/`setWorkersOpen` panel state — both following the store's existing conventions exactly. |
| `App.jsx` | Added a real auth gate: shows a loading state until `verifySession()` resolves, then either `LoginScreen` or the actual app — not just wiring that existed but was unused. Registered `WorkersPanel` alongside every other lazy-loaded panel (desktop right-panel, mobile "More" drawer, keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+W`). |
| `components/editor/StatusBar.jsx` | Added a Workers toggle button, following the exact pattern of the existing Git/Agent/Flow toggles, including it in `closeOthers()` so panels remain mutually exclusive. |

### A real bug found by rendering, that syntax-checking could never have caught
`WorkerPicker`'s "which divisions are expanded" state was originally computed once via `useState(() => new Set(Object.keys(groupByDivision(workers))))`. Since `workers` starts as `[]` and only gets populated after `listWorkers()`'s async fetch resolves, that initializer ran against an **empty array**, producing an empty `expanded` set — and `useState` initializers only run once, on mount, so when the real worker list arrived moments later, every division rendered permanently collapsed. Nothing was wrong syntactically; the bug only exists at runtime, with real async timing, which is exactly what the Babel-only syntax checks in Sessions 6 and 11 could never exercise. Caught immediately by the render test (`Worker items rendered: 0`), fixed by tracking "divisions ever seen" in a `useRef` (separate from the `expanded` state itself) and expanding each division the first time it's seen via a `useEffect` on `[workers]` — deliberately *not* just unioning `workers`' current divisions into `expanded` on every change, since that naive fix would have silently undone a user's own manual collapse the next time `workers` re-rendered for any unrelated reason. Recompiled and reran the exact same test to confirm the fix.

### Tested — real React render, real DOM events, real jsdom, not just syntax
- **LoginScreen** (5 cases): renders both fields with a submit button; username field is autofocused on mount; an empty submit shows a client-side validation error and does **not** call `login()`; a valid submit calls `login()` with exactly the typed values and correctly updates the global store's `isAuthenticated`/`user` state; a failing login surfaces the *actual* backend error text, not a generic fallback.
- **WorkersPanel** (5 cases, after the bug fix above): all 3 mocked workers render, correctly grouped into 3 divisions; exactly 1 delegation badge shows (matching Session 10's `product-manager`-only `spawn_agent` grant); selecting a Worker, entering a goal, and running it correctly streams live step events and renders the final result; switching to Coordinated Plan mode and running it correctly calls the real coordinator endpoint shape and renders per-subtask results; a failing `listWorkers()` call surfaces a real, visible error instead of silently rendering an empty panel.
- One jsdom environment gap (`scrollIntoView` isn't implemented — jsdom has no layout engine, this is expected and well-known) was polyfilled in the **test setup**, not worked around in production code, since it's a testing-environment limitation, not a component bug.
- Babel syntax validation across every touched file (`App.jsx`, `useStore.js`, `api.js`, `StatusBar.jsx`, `LoginScreen.jsx`, `WorkersPanel.jsx`) — all clean.
- Backend regression: full server restart, confirmed `/api/health` and `/api/workers` (with real auth) still correct after all of this session's frontend-only changes (which touch no backend files).

### Known follow-ups
- No real browser test — jsdom is a DOM implementation without a layout/paint engine, so CSS visual correctness (the actual `.css` files' appearance) is completely unverified; only DOM structure and behavior were tested.
- `streamWorker`'s render test used a mocked async generator, not the real SSE-over-POST parser from Session 11 — that parser itself was tested against the real backend in Session 11, but the two haven't been tested *together* (real parser + real component) in the same test.
- No test covers the actual auth *gate* in `App.jsx` (loading → login → authenticated app transition) — `LoginScreen` and `WorkersPanel` were each tested in isolation, not the full `App.jsx` composition, which is a much larger component to safely render-test and was out of scope for this pass.
- This session's testing-approach shift (render, not just syntax-check) is worth carrying forward as the new baseline for any future component work in this project, not treated as a one-time addition — the bug it caught wouldn't have been caught any other way available in this sandbox.

## Session 13 — Porting more real personas, and a routing bug found along the way

**Goal:** continue expanding `AGENT_LIBRARY` beyond Session 8's original 16, which only covered 6 divisions (automation, design, engineering, product, quality, writing) — no marketing, sales, or finance coverage at all.

### A note on how this was actually done
Rather than invent new persona content and describe it as "ported" — which would misrepresent the source — this session fetched real, current files directly from `github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents` (`marketing/marketing-growth-hacker.md`, `sales/sales-outbound-strategist.md`, `finance/finance-financial-analyst.md`) and condensed each into this library's existing style, the same practice Session 8 established: capturing the persona's real identity, methodology, and delivery style rather than reproducing the much longer (150-250+ line) source files verbatim, which are written for a different context (marketing copy, long-form instructions) than a concise LLM system prompt needs. The repo itself has grown enormously since the original audit — worth knowing if picking up more of it later.

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `brain/agents/__init__.py` | Added `growth-hacker` (marketing), `sales-outbound-strategist` (sales), `financial-analyst` (finance) — the library's first coverage of any of these three divisions. Added corresponding keyword-routing rules to `get_best_agent_for_goal`, placed early in the rules list with specific multi-word phrases (`"growth hack"`, `"financial model"`, etc.) chosen deliberately to avoid colliding with existing single-word rules like data-engineer's `"analysis"`. |

### A real, pre-existing bug found while testing the new routing rules — unrelated to the new personas themselves
Testing "does a generic data-analysis goal still correctly avoid the new financial-analyst rule" surfaced something else entirely: **`get_best_agent_for_goal` was misrouting any goal mentioning a data "export" to `mobile-developer`.** Root cause: the matching logic was naive substring containment (`kw in goal_lower`), and `mobile-developer`'s keyword `"expo"` (for the Expo/React Native framework) is a literal substring of the word `"export"`. `"Run a data analysis on this CSV export"` matched `"expo"` before it ever reached `data-engineer`'s rules further down the list — a goal about exporting data got silently routed to a mobile app developer. This bug predates this session entirely (the rule list and matching logic are both from Session 8) and could have been misrouting real goals since Workers first became invocable; it just took a test that happened to use the word "export" to surface it. Fixed by switching to word-boundary regex matching (`\b{keyword}\b`) instead of raw substring containment — this still lets multi-word phrases like `"react native"` match correctly as phrases, it only stops a short keyword from matching as a fragment of a longer, unrelated word. Confirmed the fix both closes the false positive (export → data-engineer, correctly) and preserves the true positive (a goal that genuinely mentions Expo still correctly reaches mobile-developer).

### Tested
- Persona count and capability resolution: confirmed all 3 new personas resolve to exactly the right UCIP capabilities from their declared tools.
- Routing correctness for all 3 new personas, plus the collision-avoidance check that surfaced the real bug above.
- Confirmed the word-boundary fix doesn't just suppress the false positive — verified a genuine Expo-mentioning goal still correctly routes to `mobile-developer` after the fix, not just before it.
- Full `WorkerRuntime` integration test: `growth-hacker` run end-to-end with a scripted Brain, confirmed its actual persona text reached the Brain's context and its delegated identity carried exactly its declared capabilities.
- Full server restart and live API confirmation: `GET /api/workers` correctly shows 19 total personas including all 3 new ones with their correct divisions.
- Full regression sweep across every route from prior sessions — all still working.

### Known follow-ups
- Only 3 of the real repo's (now very large) persona catalog have been added this session — a small, deliberate batch to prove the porting-with-condensation process and fix a real bug found along the way, not a comprehensive pass. The repo has grown well beyond the ~300 originally estimated; continuing this incrementally, batch by batch, remains the right approach rather than trying to port everything in one pass.
- None of these 3 new personas were given `spawn_agent` — none of their real-world roles are natural coordination hubs the way `product-manager` is (Session 10's reasoning still applies: most personas should stay leaf-level executors).
- The word-boundary regex fix is a straightforward, low-risk change, but it's worth double-checking against the full existing rule set for any other short-keyword collisions this session didn't happen to trigger (e.g., checking every keyword against common English words it might be a substring of) — not done exhaustively here, just fixed the one that was actually found.

---

## Session 14 — Memory's Semantic division: a real knowledge graph

**Goal:** close the gap flagged since Session 4 — the Semantic `kind` on `MemoryStore` held only flat, keyword-searchable text, no actual entities or relationships. This session adds a genuine entity/relationship graph.

### Scope, stated up front
This does **not** do automatic entity extraction from free text via an LLM — that would need a live model call this sandbox can't reach (same limitation noted every session since Session 3), and shipping an untested extraction pipeline would be worse than not building one. What this session builds instead: a real, structured, directly-callable graph API (`add_entity`/`add_relationship`/`get_related`/`find_entities`) that a Worker, the Cognitive System, or a future extraction step can populate once entities have actually been identified by something else. The graph itself is complete and tested; automatically populating it from prose is explicitly deferred, not silently skipped.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `memory/graph.py` | `KnowledgeGraph` — singleton (same pattern as `WorkingMemory`/`EventBus`/`HITLQueue`), SQLite-backed via **the same `data/memory.db` file** `memory/store.py` already uses — one Memory organ, not a second store, matching Session 4's explicit design principle. `kg_entities` (deduplicated by `user_id`+`type`+`name`, with property merging on re-add rather than overwrite) and `kg_relationships` (foreign-keyed to real entities only — cannot point at a nonexistent id). `get_related()` does bounded breadth-first traversal with both a depth limit and a `max_nodes` cap (same defensive-bound philosophy as `cognitive/coordinator.py`'s dependency-wave execution), with a visited-set cycle guard since a real knowledge graph can and will have cycles. |

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `api/routes/memory.py` | Added `POST /graph/entity`, `GET /graph/entity/{id}`, `GET /graph/entities`, `POST /graph/relationship`, `GET /graph/related/{id}`, `GET /graph/stats`. |

### Tested
- **Entity dedup**: adding the same `(user, type, name)` twice returns the same id both times, and a second call's properties *merge* into the first rather than overwriting it.
- **Relationship validation**: creating a relationship to a nonexistent entity id is correctly rejected with a clear error, not silently accepted as a dangling reference.
- **Directional, multi-hop traversal**: built a small real graph (two people who each `works_on` a project, one `manages` the other) and confirmed `direction="in"` correctly finds both people connected to the project, and multi-hop traversal runs without error.
- **Cycle safety, with a real cycle**: built an actual 3-node cycle (A→B→C→A) and ran a depth-10 traversal — completed in under a millisecond, correctly found exactly the 2 other nodes without looping back through the cycle, confirming the visited-set guard works on a genuinely cyclic graph, not just an acyclic one.
- **`max_nodes` bound on a real densely-connected graph**: built a hub with 50 real outgoing edges and confirmed a `max_nodes=10` traversal correctly stops at 10 results rather than returning all 50.
- **Cascading delete**: confirmed deleting an entity also removes every relationship touching it, leaving no dangling edges.
- **Live API, full round trip**: created two real entities and a relationship between them through the actual HTTP API, confirmed `find_entities` and `get_related` return correct results, confirmed `get_related(direction="in")` on the project entity correctly surfaces the person entity that `builds` it.
- Confirmed via direct SQLite inspection that the graph's tables (`kg_entities`, `kg_relationships`) live in the exact same `data/memory.db` file as `memories` — one Memory organ, not a parallel store.
- Full regression sweep across every route from prior sessions — all still working.

### Known follow-ups
- No automatic extraction from free text — see Scope note above. The natural next integration point is a Worker (or the Cognitive System's reflection step) explicitly calling `add_entity`/`add_relationship` as part of its own reasoning, once there's a live LLM to test that against.
- No Worker currently has a tool/capability mapped to the graph API (no `ACTION_TO_CAP` entry, no tool contract, no `core/loop.py` dispatch) — it's reachable via direct API calls and Python imports, but not yet something a Worker's Brain can invoke as an action the way `search_web`/`spawn_agent` are. That's a bounded, well-understood next step following the exact pattern Session 10 used for `spawn_agent`, not attempted this session to keep this piece focused.
- Still SQLite-only, per this environment's actual configuration (same honest limitation as every Memory-related session since Session 4) — the interface is designed so a Supabase/Postgres/real-pgvector-backed implementation could satisfy the same calls later, but that swap is unbuilt and untested here.

---

## Session 15 — Giving Workers an actual tool to use the knowledge graph

**Goal:** close the gap flagged at the end of Session 14 — the knowledge graph existed and was fully tested, but no Worker had an actual tool/action to call it. Followed the exact pattern Session 10 established for `spawn_agent`: register a capability mapping, register a tool contract, wire dispatch in `core/loop.py`, then make a deliberate call about which personas actually get it.

### New convenience API (before wiring the tool itself)
`add_entity`/`add_relationship` (Session 14) are keyed by entity UUID — correct for a REST API, but awkward for an LLM-driven action, since a Brain reasoning about "Alice works_on Agency OS" doesn't know either entity's UUID and shouldn't need a separate lookup step first. Added to `memory/graph.py`:
- `upsert_relationship(user_id, from_type, from_name, to_type, to_name, relation_type, properties=None)` — creates both entities by name if they don't exist (via `add_entity`'s existing dedup) and links them in one call.
- `query_by_name(user_id, name, ...)` — resolves an entity by name first, then traverses. Returns an explicit `found: False` rather than an empty list when the name isn't in the graph at all, so "nothing connected to X" is distinguishable from "X isn't recorded."

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `governance/ucip.py` | Added `graph_remember`→`ucip:memory.write` and `graph_query`→`ucip:memory.read` to `ACTION_TO_CAP` — deliberately reusing Memory's existing capabilities rather than inventing a separate "graph" capability domain, since the graph IS Memory's semantic division, not a distinct concern. |
| `governance/tool_contracts.py` | Registered both as real tool contracts. Neither is HITL-gated (confirmed neither `ucip:memory.read` nor `ucip:memory.write` is in `HITL_REQUIRED_CAPS`) — recording or looking up a structured fact doesn't carry the same risk profile as deleting a file or spawning an autonomous sub-agent. |
| `core/loop.py` | Added `graph_remember`/`graph_query` dispatch, following `spawn_agent`'s exact defensive shape: parse JSON input, catch malformed input with a clear correction message fed back to the Brain (not a crash), turn the result into a plain-language observation appended to the conversation. |
| `brain/agents/__init__.py` | Granted `graph_remember`/`graph_query` to `technical-writer` (naturally builds a map of how documented concepts relate to each other) and `product-manager` (already delegation-capable from Session 10; coordinating specialists' work naturally involves tracking who/what connects to what). Deliberately not granted broadly — same reasoning Session 10 established for `spawn_agent`: most personas should stay focused executors, not accumulate every capability by default. |

### Tested
- **Capability presence**: confirmed `technical-writer`'s delegated identity actually carries `ucip:memory.write`/`ucip:memory.read` after `WorkerRuntime` delegation, not just declared in the persona's `tools` list.
- **Full real end-to-end run**: a scripted `technical-writer` Worker called `graph_remember` to record `WorkersPanel --depends_on--> api.js`, confirmed the "Recorded: ..." observation reached the Brain's actual context, then called `graph_query` on `"WorkersPanel"` in a later turn and confirmed the real relationship text (not a canned response) came back and reached the Brain's context again, then completed correctly.
- **Independent verification**: after the loop finished, queried the graph directly (bypassing the loop entirely) and confirmed the fact was genuinely persisted — not just claimed by the mocked Brain's final answer.
- **Malformed input**: a non-JSON `graph_remember` call is caught and fed back as a clear correction, not a crash.
- Full server restart, confirmed via the live API that both personas' tool lists correctly show the new grants, and confirmed per-user isolation (the live admin session's graph stats correctly show 0 entities, separate from the test users used at the Python level).
- Full regression sweep across every route from prior sessions — all still working.

### Known follow-ups
- Only 2 of 19 personas have graph access — a deliberate, narrow starting set to prove the mechanism, same posture Session 10 took with `spawn_agent`. Worth revisiting as more personas get ported and some turn out to have a genuine fit.
- No live LLM was reachable from this sandbox (same limitation noted every session since Session 3) — a real model's judgment about *when* it's actually useful to record or query a fact (as opposed to just being technically able to) is unverified here.
- `graph_query`'s name-matching is a simple `LIKE %name%` substring search (from `find_entities`, Session 14) — fine for a small graph, but worth revisiting if entity names start colliding at scale (e.g. two different "API" entities in different contexts).

---

## Session 16 — One more persona, and a deeper pattern in the routing heuristic

**Goal:** continue expanding `AGENT_LIBRARY`. Added `support-responder` (the library's first `support` division coverage), condensed from real content for the actual "Support Responder" persona. Testing its new routing rule surfaced something more significant than a single bug — a second and third instance of the *same class* of problem Session 13 found, in a different shape.

### New persona
| Slug | Division | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `support-responder` | support | Condensed from the real msitarzewski/agency-agents "Support Responder" persona (multi-channel support, diagnose-before-fixing, resolution-as-knowledge-base-opportunity), same practice established in Sessions 8 and 13 — capturing identity/methodology/delivery style, not reproducing the much longer source verbatim. |

### Two more routing bugs found, both pre-existing, both a variant of Session 13's finding
Session 13 fixed a *substring* false-positive (`"expo"` matching inside `"export"`). This session's testing surfaced the same underlying fragility showing up differently — **priority**, not substring matching:
1. `"Fix a SQL injection vulnerability in the login endpoint"` was routing to `backend-engineer`, not `security-engineer` — because the goal genuinely contains keywords from *both* rules (`"sql"`/`"endpoint"` for backend, `"injection"` for security), and `backend-engineer`'s rule was checked first in the list purely by position, not because it was the more relevant match. A goal reporting a security vulnerability was being handed to a generalist backend engineer instead of the security specialist.
2. Fixing #1 and re-running the full regression suite (a habit now, not optional) surfaced a *third* case: `"Set up a CI/CD pipeline with Docker and nginx"` was routing to `python-specialist`, because `python-specialist`'s keyword list included the bare, overly generic word `"pipeline"` — which matches a CI/CD pipeline goal just as easily as a data pipeline goal, and `python-specialist`'s rule came before `devops-engineer`'s.

**Fixes**: reordered `security-engineer`'s rule to be checked before `backend-engineer`'s (security-specific terms are a more specific, higher-priority signal than generic infra terms that can co-occur in the same goal), and narrowed `python-specialist`'s keyword from bare `"pipeline"` to `"data pipeline"`/`"etl pipeline"` (the two things it should actually catch, without the ambiguous bare word). Both are targeted, minimal fixes — not a rewrite of the routing algorithm — verified against an 11-case regression suite covering every routing fix and addition across Sessions 13 and 16 together, not just the two new cases in isolation.

### A worth-naming architectural observation, not fixed this session
Three of these bugs now, across two sessions, from a small number of test goals — all from the same root cause: `get_best_agent_for_goal`'s first-match-wins, single-keyword-list design has no way to prefer a *more specific* match over an *earlier* one when a goal genuinely contains signals for multiple rules. Targeted fixes work but don't scale — every new persona added is a new opportunity for the same class of collision, and each one currently gets caught only if a test happens to phrase a goal in the specific way that triggers it. A more principled fix (e.g., score every rule by number/specificity of matched keywords and pick the highest-scoring one, rather than the first one checked) is a real, bounded piece of future work, flagged explicitly rather than attempted piecemeal in this same session.

### Tested
- `support-responder`: capability resolution, routing correctness, and a full `WorkerRuntime` integration test confirming its actual persona text reaches the Brain's context.
- An 11-case routing regression suite spanning every fix/addition from Sessions 13 and 16 together: the two new bugs (now fixed), the two Session 13 fixes (still holding), and every new persona's routing (still correct) — run together in one suite specifically so a future session can rerun it as a single check rather than re-deriving these cases from scratch.
- Full server restart, confirmed via the live API that all 20 personas are present with `support-responder` correctly in the `support` division.
- Full backend regression sweep (files/git/graph) — all still working.

### Known follow-ups
- The architectural observation above — a scoring-based router — is real, bounded future work, not attempted here.
- Only 20 of the real repo's (large and growing) persona catalog have been ported so far.
- No live LLM reachable from this sandbox, same limitation every session since Session 3 — all persona/routing testing uses scripted Brain responses.

## Session 17 — Rewriting the routing heuristic itself, not another patch

**Goal:** the highest-priority item flagged at the end of Session 16 — three separate routing bugs across two sessions had all traced back to the same root cause (`get_best_agent_for_goal`'s first-match-wins list scan), so this session replaces the mechanism itself rather than continuing to patch individual collisions as testing happens to find them.

### The change
`get_best_agent_for_goal` now scores every rule instead of stopping at the first match. For each rule, every keyword that actually matches (still via Session 13's word-boundary regex, unchanged) contributes its **word count** to that rule's score — a 3-word phrase match (`"review my code"`) outweighs three separate 1-word matches, and a rule with one specific multi-word match beats a rule with one generic single-word match regardless of which rule appears earlier in the list. The highest-scoring rule wins; ties keep the earlier rule (rare, given specificity weighting does most of the work). Same function signature, same return type — every existing caller (`brain/builder.py`, `cognitive/coordinator.py`) needed zero changes.

### Tested
- **Full regression, both sessions' fixes together**: reran all 11 cases from Session 16's suite (both new bugs' fixes, both Session 13 fixes, and every new persona's routing) — all still pass under the new scoring algorithm, confirming the rewrite doesn't just fix the pattern in theory but preserves every concrete case already known to matter.
- **New adversarial probes designed to test scoring specifically, not just re-confirm old fixes**: a goal mixing "full stack"+"web app" (fullstack-engineer, 4 total specificity points) against "api"+"backend" (backend-engineer, 2 points) correctly favors the more specific match. Two other probes landed on defensible-but-debatable outcomes for genuinely ambiguous goals (a goal that's plausibly *either* a code review or a security task) — reported honestly as ambiguous rather than claimed as further bugs the rewrite fixed, since my own guessed "expected" answers for those probes weren't validated ground truth.
- **A real, smaller limitation surfaced by the same testing, not fixed this session**: the matcher has no plural/singular normalization — `"vulnerability"` (singular, in `security-engineer`'s keyword list) does not match a goal that says `"vulnerabilities"` (plural), since word-boundary matching requires the literal token. This is a separate, smaller gap from the position-based bug this session fixes; noted rather than silently left for someone to eventually rediscover.
- Full server restart and live regression sweep (files/git/workers/graph) — all still correct.
- Confirmed live through the actual `POST /api/workers/plan/run` endpoint, not just the Python function directly: a SQL-injection goal now correctly dispatches to `security-engineer` through the real Coordinator, not just in an isolated unit test.

### Known follow-ups
- No lemmatization/stemming — the plural/singular gap noted above is real but not fixed here; adding it would mean either a small hand-rolled normalization step or a new dependency, and it's not clear it's worth either without more real-world goal phrasing to check it against (no live LLM reachable from this sandbox to generate realistic goal text, same limitation every session since Session 3).
- Scoring by word-count-of-matched-keywords is a simple, explainable heuristic, not a learned or semantic model — it will still misroute a goal phrased in a way that doesn't share vocabulary with any rule's keywords, same as before. The improvement is specifically about *not letting list position override a genuinely more specific match*, not about routing quality in general.
- This is the fourth time in three sessions (13, 16, 16-again, 17) that a real bug or limitation in this exact function has surfaced from ordinary testing rather than code review — worth remembering as this library keeps growing, not treated as fully closed just because the position-based root cause is now fixed.

---

## Session 18 — Sharing the HTTP client, closing the BrainLLM overhead question

**Goal:** the last item on the "up next" list flagged since Session 9 — `BrainLLM()` construction cost ~30ms every time (real, measured), from `httpx.AsyncClient`'s connection-pool/SSL setup. Session 9 fixed the worst of it (multiple redundant constructions within one `run()` call); this session closes the rest by sharing one client process-wide.

### The change
`BrainLLM._get_http_client()` is a classmethod lazily creating (or recreating, if somehow closed) one shared `httpx.AsyncClient`, following the exact singleton pattern already used elsewhere in this codebase (`EventBus`, `HITLQueue`, `WorkingMemory`, `KnowledgeGraph`). Every `BrainLLM` instance now uses this one shared client instead of constructing its own. This isn't a workaround — `httpx.AsyncClient` is explicitly designed and documented to be reused concurrently across many requests; constructing a fresh one per instance was the actual anti-pattern.

**Also found and fixed along the way**: `BrainLLM.close()` called `self._http.aclose()` — but nothing anywhere in the codebase ever called `close()` (checked before making this change). It's the same "real infrastructure, no real caller" shape as `AgentIdentity.delegate()` before Session 8 and `WorkingMemory` before any Worker used it — except here, closing the per-instance client was about to become actively dangerous the moment sharing was introduced, since closing the shared client would break every other `BrainLLM` instance in the process. Updated `close()` to a documented no-op, with the reasoning written where a future reader (or Claude) would actually find it before reflexively calling it expecting old per-instance cleanup semantics.

### Tested
- **Construction cost, honestly measured**: confirmed the *first* `BrainLLM()` construction in a process still pays the real ~25ms one-time setup cost (this is correct and expected — someone has to create the client once), and every construction after that is near-free (sub-millisecond) — a stronger guarantee than "uniformly fast," since the cost is now paid exactly once per process lifetime rather than once per instance.
- **Shared identity, not just shared behavior**: confirmed three `BrainLLM` instances constructed with different providers and `user_id`s all reference the exact same `httpx.AsyncClient` object (`is` identity check, not just equal values).
- **Re-ran Session 9's exact concurrency measurement**: two concurrent `BrainExecutionLoop.run()` calls (with a scripted 50ms Brain delay) now complete in ~0.077s total, down from Session 9's best result of ~0.133s after its redundant-construction fix alone — a real, honestly-reported improvement, not a claim of perfect concurrency (some overhead remains, noted below).
- **Coordinator dispatch still correct**: reran a real multi-subtask `Coordinator.run_plan()` and confirmed routing and success still work correctly with the shared client under concurrent dispatch.
- Full server restart and live regression sweep (files/git/workers/graph, plus an actual worker run through `POST /api/workers/code-reviewer/run/sync` which fails cleanly on the LLM call as expected, no live Ollama reachable from this sandbox) — all still working.

### Known follow-ups
- ~0.077s for two concurrent 50ms-delay runs is a real improvement over ~0.133s, but not the theoretical ideal of ~0.05-0.06s — some residual per-instance overhead remains elsewhere in `BrainExecutionLoop.__init__` (other governance object construction) that wasn't investigated further this session, since the specific, previously-flagged question (`BrainLLM`/`httpx.AsyncClient` overhead) is now genuinely closed.
- The shared client's lifecycle is entirely implicit — it's created on first use and never explicitly closed (by design, now that `close()` is a no-op). For a long-running production process this is normal and fine; worth remembering if this codebase ever needs a clean-shutdown path that explicitly drains connections.

## Session 19 — Actually making this one app (a real miss, corrected)

**Context**: after packaging deliverables as two separate zips (backend +
frontend, each installed and run separately), Raphael pointed out — correctly
— that this directly contradicted the explicit requirement from the very
start of this project: one app, not merged parts. This was a real miss, not
a matter of interpretation. `app.py` had static-file-serving scaffolding
built in this whole time (a `/static` mount and an SPA catch-all route) that
nobody had ever actually finished wiring to the real DevOS frontend — it was
still serving a leftover placeholder from before DevOS was ever integrated.
This session fixes that for real, not just explains it away.

### What was actually done
1. **Ran `npm install` + `npm run build` against the real DevOS frontend for
   the first time in this entire project.** This had been flagged as
   untested since Session 6. It compiled cleanly on the first try — every
   component built across Sessions 6, 12, and 15 (LoginScreen, WorkersPanel,
   the rewired api.js) passed through the actual CRA production build
   pipeline without modification.
2. **Fixed `services/api.js`'s `BASE` default** from a hardcoded
   `http://localhost:8000` fallback to an empty string (same-origin relative
   requests) — the correct default once frontend and backend are the same
   process, and means one build works regardless of deployment host/port
   without needing a rebuild per environment.
3. **A real bug that fix immediately exposed**: `openStreamingTerminal()`
   builds a `WebSocket` URL via `BASE.replace(/^http/, "ws")` — with `BASE`
   now empty, that produces a scheme-less, invalid URL that would throw at
   runtime. Unlike `fetch`/`EventSource`, `WebSocket` cannot resolve a bare
   relative path against the page's origin with the correct `ws`/`wss`
   scheme automatically. Fixed by deriving the scheme explicitly from
   `window.location.protocol` when `BASE` is empty.
4. **Replaced the placeholder `frontend/static`+`frontend/templates`** (old
   Jinja2/basic-JS templates) with the real build output, in the exact slot
   `app.py` already expected.
5. **Rewrote the `Dockerfile` as a genuine multi-stage build** — the
   frontend build is now a stage of the same Dockerfile (`node:20-slim` →
   `npm install && npm run build` → copy output into the Python stage), not
   a manual step someone has to remember to run before `docker build`.
6. **Repackaged as one zip** (`agency-os.zip`): backend + already-built
   `frontend/` (runs immediately with just `pip install` + `uvicorn`, no
   Node required) + `frontend-src/` (for Docker builds or anyone who wants
   to modify and rebuild the UI). The two separate zips from before are
   retired.

### Tested — on the real running server, not just "should work"
- `GET /` on the exact same process serving `/api/*` now returns the real
  DevOS login page HTML (previously returned the old placeholder).
- Static JS/CSS assets referenced by the real build (`/static/js/main.*.js`,
  `/static/css/main.*.css`) load correctly (200) from the same process.
- Confirmed the compiled bundle no longer contains the old hardcoded
  `localhost:8000` string — the `BASE` fix genuinely made it into the
  production build, not just the source.
- Login via `POST /api/auth/login` still works correctly, now same-origin.
- The SPA catch-all still correctly serves client-side routes (a
  non-API path returns 200 with the app shell, as it must for React Router
  / client-side navigation to work).
- One initial false alarm caught and corrected honestly: a JS asset 404
  during testing turned out to be a stale test URL referencing the
  *first* build's content hash, from before the `BASE` fix produced a new
  one on rebuild — not an actual bug. Retested against the current
  filename and confirmed 200.

### Known follow-ups
- The Docker multi-stage build path (`docker build` end to end) was not
  actually run in this sandbox — no Docker daemon available here. The
  Dockerfile's logic mirrors exactly what was manually verified to work
  (`npm run build` output dropped into `app.py`'s existing static-serving
  slot), but the Dockerfile itself as a complete artifact is unverified.
  Worth a real `docker build` the first time this runs somewhere with
  Docker available.
- Still true from every session since Session 3: no live LLM was reachable
  from this sandbox, so this whole consolidation — real and tested as it
  is — has still never seen a real model's actual output. That first real
  test is still ahead, now from a single running process instead of two.
- This should have been done as part of Session 1's original consolidation
  decision, or at latest before any deliverable was described as ready to
  install — not four sessions and one direct correction later. Noted
  plainly, not to relitigate it, but because "one app" was stated as a
  requirement on the very first message of this whole project and should
  have been checked against literally, not assumed satisfied because the
  backend consolidation (Node retired, Python kept) was real.

## Session 20 — One more real persona, and finally seeing the full real roster

**Goal:** continue expanding `AGENT_LIBRARY`. This session also finally pulled the complete, current `agency-agents` README — the real roster is **230+ agents across 16 divisions**, not the ~300 originally estimated back in the first repo audit or the ~284-remaining figure quoted in several earlier sessions. Worth correcting the record on scale, not just adding one more persona.

### New persona
| Slug | Division | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `legal-compliance-checker` | support | Condensed from the real, full msitarzewski/agency-agents "Legal Compliance Checker" file (588 lines fetched in full this time, not a short description) — GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA-aware risk assessment, precise about citing specific regulatory articles rather than vague caution, and explicit about the boundary between compliance analysis and licensed legal advice. |

### Corrected scale, for the record
The real repo (per its own current README, fetched in full this session) is **230+ agents across 16 divisions**: Engineering, Design, Paid Media, Sales, Marketing, Product, Project Management, Testing, Security, Support, Spatial Computing, Specialized, Finance, Game Development, Academic, and GIS. This library now has 21 personas across 10 of those divisions. The exact real file path for every remaining agent is now known (the full README table was fetched, not just fragments) — future porting sessions can go straight to a specific file rather than searching for it first.

### Tested
- Capability resolution: `legal-compliance-checker` correctly resolves to `{ucip:search.web, ucip:filesystem.write}` — no execution/delete/spawn capabilities, an appropriately conservative grant for a role producing policy documents and analysis, not running code.
- Routing: two GDPR/HIPAA-flavored goals correctly route to `legal-compliance-checker`; re-ran the standing regression set (SQL injection → security-engineer, customer complaint → support-responder, CSV export → data-engineer) to confirm the new rule didn't collide with anything already fixed in Sessions 13, 16, and 17.
- Full `WorkerRuntime` integration: confirmed the persona's actual system prompt text reached the Brain's real context and the delegated identity carried exactly the expected capabilities.
- Full server restart, live API confirmation (21 workers, `legal-compliance-checker` present), and full regression sweep (files/git/graph) — all still working.

### Known follow-ups
- 21 of 230+ real personas ported. With the full roster now known precisely, future sessions can batch more efficiently — no more searching for file paths, just fetching and condensing.
- Still true every session since Session 3: no live LLM reachable from this sandbox.

---

## Session 21 — A large persona batch, an honest count correction, and closing what's actually closable for production testing

**Context**: asked to port toward 130 personas and close out most remaining production-testing gaps. Neither target is fully reachable in this sandbox, and this section says exactly why and how far this session actually got, rather than rounding up.

### The persona count, corrected again
Fetched the complete, current `agency-agents` README in full this session (not fragments). The real, authoritative figure: **230+ agents across 16 divisions** (Engineering, Design, Paid Media, Sales, Marketing, Product, Project Management, Testing, Security, Support, Spatial Computing, Specialized, Finance, Game Development, Academic, GIS). A search result along the way claimed "61 agents" — that turned out to be the Windsurf integration's curated subset for one specific tool, not the full catalog; worth naming since it could otherwise get miscited the way "230+" itself was miscited in earlier sessions.

### A deliberate, disclosed change in porting method for this batch
Every persona through Session 20 was condensed from an **individually-fetched, full source file** — the real system prompt, read in full, then condensed. Doing that 100+ more times in one pass wasn't realistic without either an enormous token cost or abandoning the testing discipline this project has run on since Session 8. Instead, this session pulled the real README's **specialty + when-to-use columns** (genuinely sourced data, not invented) for 85 new agents and generated each persona through a shared template (identity + when-to-use + a generic but real APPROACH/DELIVERABLES structure), rather than a bespoke, individually-crafted system prompt. **This is a real quality trade-off, stated plainly**: these 85 are less rich than the individually-fetched ones, and their tool grants and routing keywords were assigned by a person (Claude) applying judgment to a short description, not read off an actual declared-tools list the way `resolve_worker_capabilities` normally reflects real source data.

**New total: 106 personas** (21 individually-fetched + 85 templated), not 130. The gap to 130 is real and stated here, not padded.

### New files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `brain/agents/_batch2_data.py` | The 85-entry batch data: `(slug, name, division, specialty, when_to_use, tools, routing_keywords)`, sourced from the real README table. |
| `.env.example` | A real, actually-shipped example env file — documented in the setup guide since Session 19 but never actually created as a file until now. |

### Modified files
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `brain/agents/__init__.py` | Added `_make_templated_persona()` and merged all 85 batch entries into `AGENT_LIBRARY` at import time. Appended the batch's routing keywords to `get_best_agent_for_goal`'s rules list — safe to simply append, not carefully position, thanks to Session 17's scoring rewrite (a rule's rank depends on match specificity now, not list position). |

### Tested, and a real finding from that testing
- Confirmed 106 total personas, zero slug collisions with the existing 21 (checked programmatically before merging, not just assumed).
- Ran the full standing regression set from Sessions 13/16/17/20 (11 cases) — all still pass, confirming the large batch didn't disturb any previously-fixed routing.
- **Sampled 10 goals against the new batch — 4 initially failed with no match at all** (not a misroute — a match failure). Root cause: the routing keywords I chose for those 4 personas were phrase-based and too narrow for how someone would naturally phrase the goal (`"threat model"` vs. the keyword `"threat modeling"`; `"app store listing"` vs. `"app store optimization"`; `"WCAG accessibility audit"` vs. the adjacent-word phrase `"wcag audit"` — the extra word "accessibility" in between broke the match; `"query performance"`/`"add the right indexes"` vs. `"slow query"`/`"database indexing"`). Rather than loosen my test to match the keywords I'd already picked, widened the actual keyword lists to include the more natural phrasings, then reran — all 10 now correctly route. This is disclosed as a real, expected consequence of generating 85 routing rules in one batch without the kind of iterative, real-goal testing that refined the original rules over three sessions (13, 16, 17) — the templated batch's routing is very likely less well-tuned than the individually-verified rules, and more gaps like these four should be expected as real usage surfaces them.
- Full `WorkerRuntime` integration test on a sampled new-batch persona (`security-architect`) — confirmed its real persona text reached the Brain's actual context.
- Full server restart and a genuinely comprehensive live regression sweep in one pass, touching every subsystem built across all 21 sessions on the same running process: 106 workers live via the API, files/git routes, governance identity/delegation, memory search, the knowledge graph, the Communications SSE stream, the multi-worker Coordinator's `plan/run` endpoint, and confirmation the real DevOS frontend is still served correctly from that same process (Session 19's consolidation). All correct together, not just individually.

### What's genuinely still blocked, not attempted, not faked
- **A real `docker build` test** — still no Docker daemon available in this sandbox. The Dockerfile's logic is unchanged and was reasoned through carefully in Session 19, but the full build has still never actually been run.
- **A real browser smoke-test** — still no real browser available here. The production build compiles and serves correctly (Session 19), and individual components render correctly under jsdom (Sessions 12-13), but nobody has ever actually clicked through this UI in an actual browser.
- These two are the honest remainder of "full production testing" that this environment cannot close — not oversights, structural limits of this sandbox. The single most valuable thing that could happen next for this whole project is exactly what was true at the end of Session 20: a real person, on a real machine, with a real browser and a real LLM, actually running this.

## Session 22 — A real audit, not more features: what "production grade" actually requires

**Context**: asked to make sure everything is solid enough for serious
production use — specifically automation workflows and full-stack website
generation — with no placeholders, everything either fixed or explicitly
logged as environment-blocked. This session did a real audit first (not
assumed), then fixed what was found, with the same testing discipline as
every prior session. See `PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` for the full staged plan
this session's findings feed into.

### Real, serious bugs found and fixed
1. **Every script execution was silently broken.** `execution/runner.py`'s
   `SCRIPT_DIR` was a relative path (`Path("data/scripts")`), used both as
   the subprocess's `cwd` *and* to build the script file's path passed as
   a command argument. Relative-path-as-argument + relative-path-as-cwd
   meant the path got resolved twice, producing a nonexistent doubled path
   (`data/scripts/data/scripts/{id}.py`). This broke `POST
   /api/scripts/{id}/run` completely — the very first real test of
   automation execution across 22 sessions immediately hit it. Fixed by
   making `SCRIPT_DIR`/`VENV_DIR` absolute at module load. Verified: a real
   script now genuinely runs and returns real stdout.
2. **Secrets management didn't exist anywhere in the backend**, despite
   `execution/runner.py`'s `ExecutionLayer.run()` already accepting a
   `secrets` parameter that nothing ever populated, and the frontend's
   `FlowPanel` already expecting a `/secrets` API that was never built.
   Added a real `Secret` model (`core/database.py`), Fernet encryption
   deriving its key from the already-required `JWT_SECRET` via PBKDF2
   rather than requiring a second secret to manage
   (`governance/secrets_vault.py`), real CRUD routes (`api/routes/secrets.py`),
   and wired real decryption + injection into both the manual-run and
   scheduled-run execution paths.
3. **Scheduled/cron automation was never actually live.** The APScheduler
   instance and its job-registration logic (`api/scheduler.py`) were real,
   not placeholders — but `api/routes/scripts.py`'s create/update/delete
   handlers never called any of it. A script created with
   `schedule_type="cron"` sat completely inert until the next full server
   restart (when `_reload_jobs()` happens to run once, at startup).
   Exposed `schedule_script()`/`unschedule_script()` as public entry points
   and wired them into create/update/delete so a schedule change takes
   effect immediately.
4. **`FlowPanel.jsx` — the actual automation workflow UI — was completely
   disconnected from the real backend.** It had its own separate `fetch`
   client (`flowFetch`) pointed at `http://localhost:3001` (the Node
   backend retired in Session 1) with a `/api/flow` path prefix that never
   existed on CaraiOS, field names (`packages`, `schedule`, `scheduleType`,
   `s.status`) that don't match the real `Script` model, a nonexistent
   `/secrets` API, and a live-SSE-streaming run view for a backend that has
   never streamed anything (`POST /run` is fire-and-forget; results only
   appear via polling `GET /runs`). This component had never been touched
   or audited in 21 prior sessions. Fully rewritten against the real
   backend and real field names, with genuine polling replacing the fake
   stream.
5. **A smaller bug in already-shipped code, found in the same pass**:
   `api.js`'s `flowStats()` (Session 6) filtered scripts by `s.enabled`,
   a field the real `Script` model doesn't have — the real field is
   `is_active`. Silently always reported 0 "enabled" scripts. Fixed.

### A real finding while investigating #1 that was itself a false alarm
During debugging, a test appeared to show a correctly-fetched secret
somehow not reaching a scheduled script's environment. Added temporary
debug logging directly into the execution path rather than continuing to
guess — the logging conclusively showed the secret *was* present and
correctly passed at every step. The actual cause was a bug in the test
script itself: an unnecessarily convoluted `chr()`-based string
obfuscation (used to dodge shell-quoting issues) had accidentally baked
literal quote characters into the environment-variable name being looked
up. Fixed the test, confirmed clean, removed the debug logging. Noted here
because it's a good example of the discipline this project has tried to
hold to: get runtime evidence before concluding something is broken,
including when the thing that turns out to be broken is the test itself.

### Also this session
- Corrected the persona-catalog scale figure again, with the complete real
  README fetched in full this time: **230+ agents across 16 divisions**
  (a search result along the way claimed "61," which turned out to be a
  different tool's curated subset, not the real catalog).
- Added 85 more personas via a disclosed, lighter-weight templated method
  (real specialty/when-to-use data from the README, generated system
  prompt rather than an individually-fetched full source file) —
  **106 total personas**. Found and fixed 4 real routing-keyword gaps in
  that batch via testing (goals that should have matched a new persona but
  didn't, because the chosen keywords were narrower than natural phrasing).
- Added `.env.example` — documented in the setup guide since Session 19,
  never actually shipped as a file until now.
- Wrote `PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` — a staged plan for everything found but not
  yet fixed, ordered by priority against the actual stated goal
  (production-grade automation workflows and full-stack website
  generation), with the two flagship gaps (Builder has no UI trigger;
  several frontend panels are broken/placeholder) named explicitly as
  Stage 1 and Stage 2.

### Tested
- The double-path execution bug: reproduced, fixed, reran — a real script
  now genuinely executes and returns real stdout.
- Secrets: full round-trip (encrypt/decrypt), a changed-key error path,
  and — the test that matters — a real script reading a real injected
  secret via `os.environ`, confirmed through both the manual-run and
  scheduled-run paths independently.
- Live scheduling: created an interval script through the real API,
  watched it genuinely auto-execute three times over 7 seconds with zero
  manual trigger; confirmed it also correctly reloads across a real server
  restart.
- `FlowPanel`: a real compiled React component, rendered in jsdom, driving
  the actual live backend through a complete flow — real login, real script
  creation through the real form, real save, real run trigger, real
  polling of `/runs`, real stdout displayed in the UI. This is the
  strongest test this project has run on a frontend component — not a
  mock, the actual live server.
- `ProjectBuilder` (the full-stack generator): ran it end-to-end with a
  scripted Brain for the first time in 22 sessions — confirmed it
  genuinely generates all template files, verifies syntax, and saves into
  the exact same project-directory convention the IDE's `FileService`
  already uses (confirmed by checking both sides see the identical file
  list).
- Full regression sweep (workers, files, git, graph, secrets, scripts) —
  all still correct together on the same running server.

### What's honestly still not done — see PRODUCTION_PLAN.md for the staged order
- No frontend trigger for `ProjectBuilder` exists at all — the full-stack
  generator works, but nothing in the UI can start one. Stage 1.
- `AgentPanel`, `ChatSidebar`, `SearchPanel` are confirmed broken (call
  `notBuiltYet` stubs). No HITL approval UI exists anywhere in the
  frontend despite the backend mechanism being real and tested since
  Session 1. Stage 2.
- `execution/search.py`, the binary download endpoint, and the
  Supabase/pgvector code paths remain unaudited/unverified. Stage 3.
- 106 of 230+ real personas ported; 85 of those are the lighter templated
  variety. Stage 4.
- No Docker daemon, no real browser, no live LLM reachable from this
  sandbox — structural limits of this environment, not deferred work.
  Stage 5, permanently.

## Up next (not started)

See `PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` for the full staged order. Immediate next: Stage 1
(a real frontend trigger for `ProjectBuilder`) — the single highest-priority
gap against the explicit "full-stack websites easily" requirement.
