"""
Communications — the nervous system.

Every other organ (Governance, Runtime, Cognitive System, Workers) publishes
events here instead of calling each other's callback lists directly. This is
the first concrete piece of the Communications organ from the v2 architecture
(Agency-OS-Master-Plan.md §1) — an in-process async pub/sub bus, with a
bounded per-topic replay buffer so a client that connects slightly late (or
briefly drops and reconnects) doesn't miss what just happened.

Scope note: this is intentionally in-process only for now (single FastAPI
process, matching the Acer Aspire One Micro/Standard profiles). Distributed
execution (multiple CaraiOS processes/machines) is real Communications-organ
scope per the master plan, but is out of scope for this pass — it would need
a real broker (Redis pub/sub or NATS) behind the same publish()/subscribe()
interface. The interface below is written so that swap is possible later
without touching any caller.
