"""
Workers — Runtime.

Closes the Stage 3 gap: `brain/agents/__init__.py`'s AGENT_LIBRARY has 16
real persona definitions (ported from msitarzewski/agency-agents, MIT)
sitting as pure data — nothing in the codebase invoked them before this
module. This is the wrapper that turns a persona into an actually-runnable
Worker:

  1. Maps the persona's declared `tools` (already named after the exact
     ACTION_TO_CAP keys in governance/ucip.py — no separate mapping table
     needed) to real UCIP capabilities.
  2. Delegates a properly narrowed child identity from the requesting
     user's identity via AgentIdentity.delegate() (built in Session 3,
     had no real caller until now — this is its first one).
  3. Runs the Worker's goal through the existing BrainExecutionLoop, with
     the persona's system prompt composed into the loop's context and the
     delegated identity governing what it's actually allowed to do.

A Worker can only ever do what BOTH its persona declares AND what the
requesting user's own identity already permits — delegation narrows,
per Session 3's design, so a low-trust user can't summon a Worker to
exceed their own capabilities just by asking nicely.
