"""
Cognitive System — Reflection.

Session 3 added expected_outcome_schema validation to mark_complete: a
*structural* check (does the output have the right shape?). This module
adds the piece that was still missing: a *qualitative* check (does the
output actually satisfy what was asked, even if its shape is fine?). A
perfectly-shaped JSON answer can still be wrong, incomplete, or off-topic —
schema validation can't catch that, only genuine critique can.

Deliberately NOT gating completion by default. Reflection is opt-in
(BrainExecutionLoop.run(..., use_reflection=True)) because it costs an
extra LLM call on every completion and, unlike schema validation, its
"failure" verdict is a judgment call rather than a hard structural fact —
forcing every task through a second, possibly-wrong LLM's opinion of a
first LLM's work is a real behavior change that callers should opt into
deliberately, not receive as a silent default.
