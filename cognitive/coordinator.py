"""
Cognitive System — Coordinator.

Closes the last flagged Stage 3 gap: Session 7's GoalDecomposer produces a
real subtask DAG, and Session 8's WorkerRuntime can run a single Worker
under a properly delegated identity — but nothing connected the two.
Without this module, a decomposed plan was still worked through
sequentially by one generalist Brain (Session 7's own "known follow-up"
noted this explicitly). This is the actual multi-worker coordination piece:
each subtask gets routed to whichever Worker persona best matches it (via
brain.agents.get_best_agent_for_goal, which already existed and was only
used by brain/builder.py — same "real infrastructure, no caller yet"
pattern as AGENT_LIBRARY and AgentIdentity.delegate() before their first
real use), and subtasks run in dependency order, with subtasks that have no
unmet dependencies between each other run concurrently.

Scope note: this dispatches subtasks from ONE decomposed goal to potentially
several Workers. It is not yet Worker-to-Worker delegation (a Worker's own
task spawning a further-delegated sub-Worker) — that's a smaller, separate
extension of the same delegation_chain mechanism, not built here.
