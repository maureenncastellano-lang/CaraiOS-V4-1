"""Files route — IDE file tree, read, write, create, rename, delete.
Scoped to data/projects/{user_id}/{project_id}/, the same convention
brain/builder.py uses, so the IDE and Project Builder share one file tree.
Destructive actions (delete) go through the same HITL gate as autonomous
Brain actions, since a file is a file regardless of who deleted it.
